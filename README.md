## Overview

**Lumada AI** is an intelligent multi-agent framework designed to scan the Hitachi Group's products and solutions websites. It utilizes a supervisor agent named **LumadaAI**, which dynamically selects the appropriate agent based on the user's query. This framework allows for efficient and effective retrieval of information from a wide range of resources within the Hitachi Group.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Framework**: Incorporates several agents, each specialized in different areas of Hitachi's offerings.
- **Dynamic Query Handling**: The supervisor agent (LumadaAI) analyzes user queries and routes them to the appropriate agent.
- **Pre-Scraped Data**: The relevant information from the Hitachi Energy websites has already been scraped and is stored in a JSON file for quick access.
