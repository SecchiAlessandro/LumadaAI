Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store. At the same time, they share the same excellent fire-resistant, explosion-proof characteristics, and other advantages of traditional dry or RIP bushings.\n\nOur RIS bushings are available for AC transformers and reactors.\n \n\nWhy is Hitachi Energy your preferred partner?\n\nComplete range and outstanding performance under the most demanding conditions\n\nMany years of proven reliability in all continents\n\nState-of-the-art production facilities and 100 years of transformer components manufacturing experience\n\nFlexible design allows for adaptation to different customer needs and transformer requirements\n\nCompletely dry bushing, i.e., no oil spills, no explosion risk\n\nNo maintenance or constant monitoring is necessary\nTransport and storage is possible in all positions\nPartial discharge-free up to double service voltage\nLearn more\nNon-condenser Core Bushings\n\nHitachi Energy offers a complete range of non-condenser core bushings for reliably connecting distribution and power transformers.

By upgrading the cooling capacity, capital optimization could also be achieved by increasing the rated capacity of the transformer. A well-functioned cooling system requires regular maintenance. Depending on the type, the life expectancy of the cooling devices can be much shorter than the transformer active part and tank.\n\nCooling system replacement/upgrades: The need to replace or upgrade the cooling system can emerge from a variety of situations, such as old age, “wear and tear,” the move of the transformer, and adaptation to new design technology. Upgrades of cooling systems enable an increase in the loading capacity of the transformer.\n\nOne-to-one Replacement\nSingle-tube to double tube\nOil-water to oil-air\nUpgrades of existing cooling solution from original size to large size\nFrom ONAN to ONAF\nScope of work\n\nCoolers are cleaned by brushing inside the water tubes or by air-side vacuum cleaning when necessary.

By performing oil reclamation, where the oil is passed through an absorbent, the oil can be reinserted into the transformer in a new state.\n\nOil is a natural material that ages due to the operating environment and transformer properties. Through oil sampling and analysis, the condition of the oil can be inferred. Aged oil demonstrates a higher concentration of oxidation and acids.\n\n\nOil reclamation or oil regeneration is a process whereby oil is processed to achieve a significant condition improvement, aimed at being as close to “as new” as possible, by removing the aging products. The processing is performed while a transformer is in service to achieve maximum effectiveness with minimum impact on on-site operations. The oil affects the insulation in the transformer, and the insulation affects the oil; hence the condition of the oil impacts the expected life of the transformer.\n\n\nThe modern reclaiming technology with the reactivation of the absorbent makes it economically feasible to use much more active absorbent material. Typically 5-10 times more absorbent is used compared with the old conventional systems. This leads to a much better cleaning effect on the paper and to the excellent long-term stability of the reclaimed oil.\n\n\nFor some transformers, there is data available for up to 10 years after reclamation. The data shows very little change in acidity and color after 10 years of operation since the oil was reclaimed.\n\n\nTo prevent excessive production of acids due to oil degradation, it is recommended that the oil be reclaimed before it is severely degraded. Low molecular weight acids migrate into the paper insulation and become much harder to remove than from the oil.\n\n\nThe essential elements of the online reclamation technology are that the absorbent is automatically reactivated after each cycle and that the transformer remains in operation. The reactivation allows for using much more active absorbent than with the classical type of reclaiming plants, where the Fullers' earth needs to be replaced frequently and thereafter disposed of. The final step is to restore the inhibitor content.\n\n\nScope of work\n\nThe essential elements of the online reclamation technology are that the absorbent is automatically reactivated after each cycle and that the transformer remains in operation. The reactivation allows for using much more active absorbent than with the classical type of reclaiming plants, where the Fullers' earth needs to be replaced frequently and thereafter disposed of. The complete oil volume is typically circulated 8 to 12 times over the Fullers' earth to achieve a long-lasting effect.

The significance of water content is paramount: laboratory samples suggest that humidity of 3-4 percent may increase the degradation rate of paper by a factor of 10 or more compared to dry paper.\n\nThis underlines the importance of assessing both the moisture and temperature of the insulation system. Temperature and vacuum are the main factors for drying speed and drying quality.\n\nFor optimized drying, the transformer should be heated at the same time as the vacuum is applied (as is done during the vapor phase process). With the combination of the low-frequency heating (LFH) technique and hot oil spray or hot oil circulation, this can also be achieved on-site.\n\n\nThe low-frequency voltage is necessary in order to reduce the applied voltage on the transformer when it is under vacuum. The reason is that the breakdown voltage of the insulation system is much lower under vacuum than under atmospheric pressure. This is also known as Paschen's law.\n\n\nIn order to prevent hotspots during drying (due to reduced cooling), the applied current for heating power transformers should not exceed 50% of the nominal current. Consequently, the copper losses will be no more than Ľ of the nominal losses, and the risk of potential hot spots at points with higher resistance will be negligible.\n\nScope of work\nPlant and process concept\n\nIn order to heat up both the low and high-voltage windings, a frequency of approximately 1 Hz is applied to the transformer.\n\n\nThe transformer can be heated uniformly with the combination of LFH drying and the conventional hot oil spray method. The LFH system heats the windings from the inside, and the hot oil spray supports the heating process by heating the outer parts of the insulation system.\n\nRelated Product Categories\nOil Regeneration or Reclamation\nHitachi Energy offers an oil reclamation or regeneration process whereby oil is processed to achieve a significant condition improvement, aimed at being as close to “as new” as possible by removing aging products.\nLearn more\nAdvanced Maintenance\nHitachi Energy provides advanced maintenance services for transformers to be performed on-site that aim to extend the life of your assets.\nLearn more\nParts & Maintain\nHitachi Energy offers genuine, high-quality spare parts along with basic and advanced maintenance services.\nLearn more\n24/7/365\nOur Global Service Teams are here to support you anytime!\nCustomer Connect Center\nGet to know more\nTransformer service\nAging assets, rising energy demand, and the critical need to avoid unplanned outages are challenging worldwide utilities and industrials.

Typical applications include delayed tripping in protection applications or as time delay elements in automation control equipment and industrial processes. The unique advantage of these relays is their suitability for a wide input voltage DC or AC, and a wide setting range in a single relay.\n\nOur offering:\nRXKA RXKL RXKM\nRXKA - Time relay for pick-up or drop-out delay\n\nThe RXKA 1 relay is a universal low cost programmable timer that provides pick-up, drop-out or pulse timing functions.\n\nThe timer is used in relay applications where reliability demands are high but setting accuracy down to the millisecond is not of the issue. The timing repeatability is good and is suitable for most power system protection, logic and signalling functions, where only one change-over contact may be required.\n\nFor high demanding and short time precision applications e.g. breaker failure relaying and where two change-over contacts are needed we recommend the RXKL 1 timer. The wide range of settings permits RXKA 1 to be used as a replacement for many other types of timers.\n\nMain Features:\nDC voltage operated\nTiming range 0,1 - 320 s\nOne change-over output contact\nStart and trip self reset LED indications\nSomething caught your eye?\n\nOur sales team will get in touch with you\n\nContact us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

The COMBITEST test switches enable fail-safe in-service testing of protective relays.\n\nOur offering:\nCOMBITEST RTXP\nCOMBITEST - Relay test system\n\nCOMBITEST relay test system provides a wide range of testing capabilities. All parts of the COMBIFLEX relay and the overall system can be accessed for testing. COMBITEST also means additional personnel safety during testing.\n\nIn a test it is possible to inject signals to the isolated relay in order to observe its performance and operation limits. Problems may thus be discovered before an actual protection operation is called for. A safety feature in COMBITEST is that CT shorting is automatic upon insertion of the test handle into the test switch. No external shorting links are needed on the test handle. Trip circuits are interrupted prior to CT shorting during insertion of the test handle.\n\nThe secondary injection test facility can also be used to enable the relay system to receive a simulated or recorded power system event in “play-back” mode. This permits testing of cases, which may have caused confusion or concern in relay operation or lack of operation. Numerical play-back can also be further facilitated using test system simulation software.\n\nMain Features:\nFail-safe sequence disconnecting trip circuits when the test-plug handle is inserted.\nLatching feature so that when the test-plug handle is withdrawn the relay stabilises in its reset position before the trip circuits are restored.\nComplete isolation of secondary instrument transformer circuits.\nTrip-block plug, which isolates a trip circuit without interrupting other circuits, allows the trip output to be monitored, and also provides visual indication of an isolated trip circuit.\nBlock-plug handle, which disconnects all circuits, routed through the test switch.\nAmmeter test-plug with local automatic shorting device in case of inadvertent opening of a CT circuit.\nAuxiliary station power supply made available for operating test equipment.\nExtension bases which facilitate measurement and adjustment of plug-in module circuits. \nSomething caught your eye?\n\nOur sales team will get in touch with you\n\nContact us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

For the past 60 years, oil-filled, paper-insulated condenser bushings have been applied to power transformers. While they have faithfully served their purpose, ensuring these bushings' safe and reliable operation can be time-consuming and costly. Typical concerns voiced by users include damage or outage due to vandalism or attack, porcelain shards damaging equipment or injuring people, catastrophic fire, oil leaks, and flashover due to contamination.​\n\nThe ANSI/IEEE market solution is the O Plus Dry™ bushing. Hitachi Energy's O Plus Dry bushing meets or exceeds IEEE standards. It uses no paper and no porcelain and contains no oil. It is less fragile than porcelain bushings and lighter in weight. It uses HTV silicone rubber weather sheds, which are hydrophobic and self-cleaning even in highly polluted environments.​\n \n\nProduct scope:\nVoltage: 25-230 kV\nCurrent: ≤ 3000 A\nTechnology: Resin impregnated synthetic (RIS)\nWhy O Plus Dry?\nReduced maintenance needs\nNo oil and no porcelain\nExplosion resistant\nFire retardant\nHydrophobic and self-cleaning\nSomething caught your eye?\n\nOur sales team will get in touch with you\n\nContact us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

The type-tested variants are equipped and configured with extensive monitoring functionality, and with default parameters for easy handling of products – from ordering, engineering, and commissioning to reliable operation. \n\nThe 650 series IEDs (Intelligent Electronic Device) have a number of useful features, such as a significantly reduced number of parameter settings and extended IED HMI functionality, including 15 dynamic three-color indication LEDs per page, on up to three pages, and configurable push-button shortcuts for different actions.\n\nIn the 650 series IEDs, the most basic parameters are set before delivery from the factory. You only need to set the parameters specific to your application. This allows you to quickly take your IEDs into operation. The application manual includes setting examples to support your protection engineers.\n\nRelion – Complete confidence\n\nBay control REC650 IEDs belong to the Relion protection and control product family. The Relion product family offers a wide range of products for the protection, control, measurement, and supervision of power systems. To ensure interoperable and future-proof solutions, Relion products have been designed to implement the core values of the IEC 61850 standard. With Hitachi Energy's leading-edge technology, global application knowledge, and experienced support network, you can be completely confident that your system performs reliably – in any situation.\n\nGet to know more\nControl capabilities Advanced interlocking\n\nUp to ten primary apparatus can be controlled and visualized locally with REC650. The control is based on the select before operate principle, which ensures secure operation and helps avoid human error.\n\nBy selecting the control screen as a default screen in REC650, you can quickly execute control commands, and see the most important measurement values and position indications.\n\nThere are three pages of alarm indications and each page consists of 15 dynamic three-color indication LEDs. These three-color LEDs can present the status of any binary input signal on the HMI of REC650 IEDs.\n\nRelated offering\nPCM600\n\nTools\n\nRead more\nCOMBIFLEX\n\nModular relays and accessories\n\nRead more\nRelion 670 Series\nRead more\nRelion 650 Series\nRead more\nSubstation Automation and Protection Training\n\nOur  training offering\n\nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

Working together with our customers to better understand the environmental impact of these activities is a key pillar of our offering.\nWhile life cycle assessments (LCAs) introduce a product-oriented vision of the environmental impact that normally leaves the impact of maintenance activities and projects out of scope. They are far from negligible for our customers’ overall environmental footprint. Every small contribution matters. \n\n\nBeyond solving the energy trilemma, together.\nBeyond solving the energy trilemma, together.\nBeyond solving the energy trilemma, together.\nBeyond solving the energy trilemma, together.\nBeyond solving the energy trilemma, together.\n\nOur EconiQ™ Implementation services provide a detailed mapping of all your service and project activities’ CO2 equivalent emissions, increasing your awareness and optimizing execution to reduce or even avoid your impact, as well as compensating the remaining footprint.\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability\nImplementing strategies to reduce your carbon footprint to foresee a greener future, mitigating current environmental harm of your maintenance activities and fostering a sustainable tomorrow.\n\nReliability\nEnhancing energy security and securing reliability is one of our core values. Our offering includes solutions to allow our customers to boost their system reliability, addressing current and future system supply challenges.\n\nAffordability\nEnabling access to affordable and equitable energy through cost-effective solutions and innovative technologies, accelerating electrification, renewable integration, energy efficiency, among others.\n\nThree steps for a greener power system lifecycle\nThree steps for a greener power system lifecycle\nThree steps for a greener power system lifecycle\nThree steps for a greener power system lifecycle\nThree steps for a greener power system lifecycle\nStep 1: Calculate\n\nMeasure and evaluate your carbon footprint. Increase the awareness of your environmental footprint through a comprehensive assessment and report.\n\n\nUnderstand your activities and their impact\nWe are committed to minimizing your environmental impact and specifically the impact of the actions we provide to you with our services, from the definition to the execution of the works.\n\n\nIdentify emission hotspots through the environmental report generated\nWith the calculations made, Hitachi Energy will generate a report containing all the details of your project and the environmental impact associated with it by category, such as equipment, construction, shipping, and traveling, among others. This report will identify the emission hotspots of your services activities.\n\nDefine data-driven greener strategies\nHaving access to this data and the possibility of comparing various scenarios will allow you to define more efficient, data-driven strategies for carbon footprint improvement.\n\nStep 2: Cut\n\nOnce the impact of all activities has been analyzed, our experts can suggest alternatives on how to implement more sustainable maintenance activities to your power system by wisely choosing products and actions having lower environmental impact.\n\nMore sustainable products and materials\nWhen designing a maintenance activity, spare parts and replacement of core products have a strong impact on the overall environmental footprint. In this context, our EconiQ™ product portfolio offers you more environmentally friendly assets (SF6-free high-voltage products, transformers with less pollutant oils, etc.). Avoiding a 100g SF6-leakage is equivalent to eliminating 2 tCO2 equivalent emissions.\n\nPreventing unnecessary activities\nPreventing unnecessary activities is one of the pillars of an efficient and sustainable maintenance strategy. After carefully considering whether a maintenance activity of a particular asset is even necessary, the next step is to think about how you can reduce the frequency of that task or if you can perform it more efficiently. This will lead to cutting the environmental impact of existing and future maintenance activities. For example, our analysis show that eliminating a small avoidable maintenance activity can result in approximately 0.5 – 1 tCO2 equivalent emission reduction.\n\nExecute with a smaller footprint\nBuilding on our domain expertise in the field and our large installed base, together we will evaluate the alternatives to execute site activities tasks more efficiently. To do so, we will examine using smart shipping strategies, finding alternatives to on-site interventions, and using digital technologies as much as possible to optimize maintenance strategies. Our analysis show that for short maintenance activities, traveling is sometimes the major contributor to the carbon footprint. Every time we avoid a flight from America to Europe using augmented reality support, we are saving more than 0.5 tCO2 equivalent emissions.\n\nStep 3: Compensate\n\nHitachi Energy offers carbon neutral and net-zero services, by adding compensation solutions to previous quantification and reduction strategies. Thanks to our key collaborations, we can now capture the CO2 emitted.\n\nCO2 offset\nOffset strategies create a compensation of the same amount of carbon emissions due to a specific service or activity.

Because of the high electrical stress levels in bushings, failures in oil-impregnated bushings with porcelain insulators tend to result in sudden and catastrophic failure of an explosive nature.\n\nCondition assessment and replacement of defect bushings, therefore, drastically reduce the risk of transformer failures. Certain types and applications may have a higher risk which is yet another reason for condition assessment. Knowing the health of your bushings allows you to take planned precautionary actions in time, be it in maintenance or replacement – all with the purpose of keeping your transformer reliable and online, supporting your network.\n\nLittle maintenance is required other than checking the oil level (if applicable), power factor and capacitance testing, and checking the condition of the top terminals. Bushings exposed to salt spray, concrete dust, and other abnormal deposits are subject to a special hazard and must be cleaned regularly to prevent flashover and corrosion of parts.\n\nOil-filled bushings may be considered for exchange to dry-type with composite insulators to reduce the consequences of failures and the need for maintenance. Repair of high-voltage condenser bushings is normally not economically justifiable. However, exceptions exist.\n\nHitachi Energy's offering includes installation, preventive maintenance, condition assessment as well as replacement or upgrades.\n\n\nRelated Product Categories\nTransformer Component Upgrades\nTransformers component upgrades are based on Hitachi Energy's decade-long experience in manufacturing and maintaining its products.\nLearn more\nTap-changer Overhaul and Upgrades\nHitachi Energy offers the best resource for all tap-changer service requirements and covers services ranging from documentation, design engineering, the latest testing and oil processing, and providing 100% OEM grade parts and life extension kits.\nLearn more\nCooling System Overhaul and Upgrades\nHitachi Energy offers one-to-one replacements and upgrades of existing cooling solutions from original size to large size transformers.\nLearn more\n24/7/365\nOur Global Service Teams are here to support you anytime!\nCustomer Connect Center\nGet to know more\nTransformer service\nAging assets, rising energy demand, and the critical need to avoid unplanned outages are challenging worldwide utilities and industrials.

Factors resulting from interconnections and power networks to aging equipment and the declining pool of technical experts add to the challenge.\n\nTap-changers are very important components in transformers and the power grid. As they are of mechanical construction, they cause concern due to their maintenance needs and their failure probability. It is, therefore, important to ensure the integrity of tap-changers as cost-effectively and reliably as possible. Moreover, reports from international studies made by, for example, CIGRE show that faults associated with tap-changers are the origin of up to one-third of the transformer failures in service.\n\nWhen you evaluate the liability of a single tap changer failure at today’s costs, establishing an effective maintenance strategy becomes a matter no one can ignore. Hitachi Energy offers a comprehensive and systematic approach to effectively maintain many manufacturers’ tap changers, including ABB, Westinghouse, Reinhausen, Moloney, GE, National Industri, and others. Our tap changer program can supplement existing in-house programs or work independently to satisfy the total maintenance need. The Hitachi Energy tap-changer team provides support 24/7, and all field services are furnished by Hitachi Energy's qualified technicians and engineers.\n\nFor services ranging from documentation and design engineering to the latest in testing and oil processing to providing 100 percent OEM grade parts and life extension kits, Hitachi Energy is the best resource for all tap changer service requirements.\n\nOur tap-changer services increase transformer life and reliability and lower maintenance and operating costs. In order to further assist our customers, Hitachi Energy offers a wide range of monitoring and diagnostic tools, from the simple way to monitor the temperature difference between the LTC/OLTC and the transformer main tank to the most advanced solutions on the market, for example, CoreTec™. This will allow a more refined diagnosis of LTC/OLTC problems to predict maintenance/overhaul needs based on actual conditions and not on the number of switching operations.\n\nIn order to further lower maintenance and operating costs, Hitachi Energy has introduced a plug-and-play concept. This means the possibility of upgrading an old oil-breaking tap changer's type UCG and UCL to vacuum technology. A work that is as easy as normal maintenance.\n\nRelated Product Categories\nTransformer Component Upgrades\nTransformers component upgrades are based on Hitachi Energy's decade-long experience in manufacturing and maintaining its products.\nLearn more\nBushing Replacements\nHitachi Energy offers repair of high-voltage condenser bushings that includes installation, preventive maintenance, condition assessment, and replacement or upgrades.\nLearn more\nCooling System Overhaul and Upgrades\nHitachi Energy offers one-to-one replacements and upgrades of existing cooling solutions from original size to large size transformers.\nLearn more\n24/7/365\nOur Global Service Teams are here to support you anytime!\nCustomer Connect Center\nGet to know more\nTransformer service\nAging assets, rising energy demand, and the critical need to avoid unplanned outages are challenging worldwide utilities and industrials.

Regular preventive maintenance helps facilitate forward budget planning for these types of services.\n\nThe main concern in aging and the life expectancy of transformers is the condition of the insulation system and key components of the transformer, like the bushing, tap changer, and cooling equipment.\n\nThe insulation system, a combination of mineral oil and paper in a transformer, degrades over time, and finally, they lose the capability to withstand the stresses a transformer might see in daily life (short circuits, energizing, vibration, etc.). The lifetime of these organic products in a transformer depends on the insulation's operating temperature, oxygen content, oil acidity, and moisture content. \n\nIt is possible to reverse the aging of mineral oil through oil reclamation that can restore the material properties close to the values when new. The aging of paper insulation, however, is an irreversible process and is considered one of the life-limiting processes of a transformer.\n\nTemperature is mainly dependent on the transformer design, the loading, the cooling facilities, and the ambient temperature.  Cooling overhaul or upgrade is a highly recommended solution for operating the transformer at a lower temperature or for power upgrade purposes. Moreover, this alternative has significant cost savings versus new transformer replacement. \n\nBushings are key components in the transformer. Thermal and electrical stress, ambient conditions, and more put high demands on bushings resulting in failures originating in the bushings, most often leading to severe consequences such as fires and explosions. Condition assessment and replacement of bushings by the latest state-of-the-art technology reduce the risk of transformer failures.\n\nOn the other hand, Tap-changers cause concern due to their service needs and failure probability, but with appropriate service and certified technicians, this probability can be dramatically reduced. As the OEM of transformers and tap-changers, our global team of experts and certified technicians stand ready to provide support 24/7. Always maintain the highest quality of service with original spare parts, the latest training, and the possibility of upgrading your OLTC.\n\nTo extend the life of your assets, Hitachi Energy provides preventive (eventually curative) actions to be performed on-site, aiming to maintain the performance of the transformer for which specific equipment and a higher degree of expertise are required. It is usually linked with diagnosis tests, engineering, and life cycle assessment to clearly determine the most appropriate route of action and ensure condition-based maintenance.\n\nOur Component Upgrades Offerings\nBushing Replacements\nHitachi Energy offers repair of high-voltage condenser bushings that includes installation, preventive maintenance, condition assessment, and replacement or upgrades.\nLearn more\nTap-changer Overhaul and Upgrades\nHitachi Energy offers the best resource for all tap-changer service requirements and covers services ranging from documentation, design engineering, the latest testing and oil processing, and providing 100% OEM grade parts and life extension kits.\nLearn more\nCooling System Overhaul and Upgrades\nHitachi Energy offers one-to-one replacements and upgrades of existing cooling solutions from original size to large size transformers.\nLearn more\nRelated Product Categories\nTransformer Refurbishment\nHitachi Energy offers refurbishment services to cover transformer rehabilitation and sustainable life extension to advance a sustainable energy future for all.\nLearn more\nLearn more\nLearn more\nLearn more\n24/7/365\nOur Global Service Teams are here to support you anytime!\nCustomer Connect Center\nGet to know more\nTransformer service\nAging assets, rising energy demand, and the critical need to avoid unplanned outages are challenging worldwide utilities and industrials.

It also feeds auxiliary converters for other electrical systems like lighting, heating, and/or onboard information systems.\n\nIf the traction transformer fails, the planned train traffic schedule may be disturbed and leads to passenger inconvenience, and even costly penalties may be incurred.\n\nScope of work\n\nA traction transformer is highly reliable and designed to perform under harsh conditions. However, to prevent unpredicted failure and ensure a long lifetime, some services are advised during the whole life cycle.\n\nThe operating conditions of a traction transformer differ highly from power transformers. Therefore the interpretation of condition checks has to be done by traction experts; otherwise, misleading results may occur.\n\nRegular oil analysis gives a good image of the actual health. Additionally, basic and advanced diagnostic tests can provide further information.\n\nIf an onboard traction transformer gets damaged by an accident or due to other reasons, we are able to fully repair the traction transformer by replacing damaged parts of the core, winding reclamping, partial or full winding replacement, and repair of the tank. At the end of such work, all electrical routine tests are done.\n\nDuring the long lifetime of a vehicle, some operational conditions change. Upgrading or replacing some parts of the traction transformer can help ensure further operation.\n\nA midlife overhaul is recommended to ensure reliability in the second half of the lifetime. All traction transformers are systematically checked and maintained by replacing parts with lower lifetime expectancy.\n\nRelated Product Categories\nWorkshop Repairs for Distribution and Small Power Transformers\nHitachi Energy offers workshop repairs for distribution and power transformers ranging from 315 kVA to 5 MVA.\nLearn more\nWorkshop Repairs for Medium and Large Power Transformers\nHitachi Energy offers workshop repairs for medium and large power transformers.\nLearn more\nTransformer Refurbishment\nHitachi Energy offers refurbishment services to cover transformer rehabilitation and sustainable life extension to advance a sustainable energy future for all.\nLearn more\nOn-site Repairs\nHitachi Energy offers on-site repairs to bring the transformer factory setup to the work site with the TrafoSiteRepair™ service that is executed to the same high-quality standard as a workshop repair.\nLearn more\nTransformer Component Upgrades\nTransformers component upgrades are based on Hitachi Energy's decade-long experience in manufacturing and maintaining its products.\nLearn more\n24/7/365\nOur Global Service Teams are here to support you anytime!\nCustomer Connect Center\nGet to know more\nTransformer service\nAging assets, rising energy demand, and the critical need to avoid unplanned outages are challenging worldwide utilities and industrials.

Thus, it requires an external 'cooling system' with a heat exchanger and ‘air fans’. This cooling system leads to additional costs, maintenance, and energy consumption for train operators. \n\n\nAs the global leader and a pioneer of traction transformer technology, Hitachi Energy has been supporting the rail industry by continuously optimizing its traction transformer solutions through constant innovation and technology enhancement. \n\n\nHitachi Energy is now introducing one such landmark solution in the form of the Natural Cooling Effilight® traction transformer (NCETT).\n\nNCETT replaces the traditional fan-based cooling system with a natural and sustainable alternative – natural airflow of the train's motion. \n\n\nThe NCETT uses a specially designed cooling system that utilizes the natural air flow caused by the train’s motion and directs it to the heat exchangers, thereby eliminating the need for motorized air fans. Heated liquid pumped into the heat exchanger is cooled with natural air instead of motorized air fans and passed back inside the transformer. \n\nThe removal of air-fan-based cooling systems reduces the overall costs incurred by train operators on energy consumption and maintenance of the cooling system. The elimination of a fan-based cooling system reduces the risk of failure and improves reliability by 20% with no downtime for the fans, motors, and their supply system. \n\nThe NCETT is designed to work in both directions of the train’s motion. It can be mounted on the roof of the train as well as the underframe. \n\nMain benefits of NCETT:\n\nOptimized Lifecycle Ownership Cost and Energy savings:\n\nSavings on the energy consumed by the power cooling motors\nZero risk of failure for the fan, cooling motors, and their supply system\nZero maintenance for the fans and cooling dampers, and reduced radiator cleaning\n\nImproved reliability and availability \n\nReliability improved by 20%  with no downtime for the motors and their supply system\nFIT (Failure In Time) rate decreased by 20% due to the absence of fans\n\nOperating noise reduction\n\n\n\nRemoval of the fan reduces the resulting noise and improves overall passenger comfort and rail experience by eliminating 10-15 dB(A) of cooling system noise\nRelated offering\nTransformers for railway \nRead more\nTransformers \nVisit the Transformers webpage\nTransformer service \nRead more\nSomething caught your eye?\n\nOur sales team will get in touch with you\n\nContact us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

In our flagship RIS line EasyDry®, we have substituted traditional paper insulation with homogeneous synthetic material, resulting in superior product properties and lifetime.\n\n\nHitachi Energy’s paperless RIS bushings are made of a synthetic non-woven material that is wound around a conductor with aluminum foil inserts for electrical stress control. The core is afterward vacuum-impregnated with epoxy resin and cured, giving a partial discharge-free dry bushing.\n\nThis paperless bushing technology has an advanced insulation performance due to its non-hygroscopic insulation that is not sensitive to moisture ingress and absorption. In addition, RIS bushings will have a superior effect on the power factor (dielectric losses), and the intrinsic aging behavior leading to an extended product lifetime.\n\n \n\nProduct Scope:\n\nVoltage: 52-550 kV\nCurrent: ≤ 5,000 A\nTechnology: Resin-impregnated synthetics (RIS) with silicone or porcelain insulator\nConductor system: Draw lead, fixed bottom contact, removable rod conductor, and draw rod conductor\nWhy choose EasyDry®\nEasy to select & purchase Easy to store & handle Easy to operate & upgrade\nAcceleration of the entire value creation process\nSimple to select the right bushing solution with our online configurator COMPAS. Comprehensive product documentation at your fingertips, online RFQ at any time.\nSeamless upgrades and replacements\nDirect replacements of the dry bushing and easy adaption for OIP bushings.

Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store. At the same time, they share the same excellent fire-resistant, explosion-proof characteristics, and other advantages of traditional dry or RIP bushings.\n\nOur RIS bushings are available for AC transformers and reactors.\n \n\nWhy is Hitachi Energy your preferred partner?\n\nComplete range and outstanding performance under the most demanding conditions\n\nMany years of proven reliability in all continents\n\nState-of-the-art production facilities and 100 years of transformer components manufacturing experience\n\nFlexible design allows for adaptation to different customer needs and transformer requirements\n\nCompletely dry bushing, i.e., no oil spills, no explosion risk\n\nNo maintenance or constant monitoring is necessary\nTransport and storage is possible in all positions\nPartial discharge-free up to double service voltage\nLearn more\nNon-condenser Core Bushings\n\nHitachi Energy offers a complete range of non-condenser core bushings for reliably connecting distribution and power transformers.

It is also used to interconnect separate power systems where traditional alternating current (AC) connections cannot be used. Hitachi Energy pioneered the HVDC technology and is the undisputed world leader in the HVDC field. HVDC transmission offers, for instance, controllability and low total investment cost compared to AC solutions for long-range transmission.\n\nIn a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) system, electric power is taken from one point in a three-phase\n\nAC network, converted to DC in a converter station, transmitted to the receiving point by an overhead line or cable, and then converted back to AC in another converter station and injected into the receiving AC network. Typically, an HVDC transmission has a rated power of more than 100 MW, and many are in the 1,000 - 3,000 MW range. Hitachi Energy has successfully developed the world's first 1,100 kV converter transformer with a power rating of 12,000 MW, breaking the record for the highest DC voltage levels ever.\n\nHVDC transmissions are used for the transmission of power over long or very long distances because it then becomes economically attractive over conventional AC lines.\n\n \n\nProduct scope\n\n80 kV - 1,100 kV\n\n \n\nWhy Hitachi Energy\n\nGlobal leader with 50 percent of all projects manufactured by Hitachi Energy\nShort-circuit performance\n50 years of proven experience, technology pioneered by Hitachi Energy\nRelated offering\nHigh-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC)\nRead more\nHigh-Voltage Switchgear & Breakers\nRead more\nTransformer service\nRead more\nTransformers\nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

Hitachi Energy experts help customers select the most appropriate solution in each situation. Based on the statistical contribution to the total loss of service or loss of revenue, the algorithm ranks substation assets from low to high importance.\n\nExpert condition assessment\n\nUsing asset-specific checklists, a Hitachi Energy expert assesses the condition of assets and collects information about a substation’s operational experience. No outage is required, so operations are not affected.\n\nAdvanced Hitachi Energy remote support solutions are available to support the on-site assessment remotely, or to reach in-house specialists for an in-depth analysis of critical assets. On top, the assessment can be combined with a 3D Scan to generate the foundation for a digital representation of the system.\n\nRed, yellow or green risk level?\n\nCombining the importance analysis with the results of a condition assessment, assets are placed in a risk matrix that illustrates the individual contribution of each one to overall risk. This helps to define recommendations that will give due priority to high risk equipment and achieve the most effective means of reducing system risk.\n\nDecisions based on facts and data\n\nHitachi Energy will recommend interventions that are tailored to the calculated risks and needs. For example, a replacement/overhaul plan will improve the substation’s condition and reduce probability of failure; upgrading substation design and its redundancies will help reduce the negative impact of failures on operations.\n\nExplore Reliability Space\nDownload the brochure\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

All our current transformers are built-to-order to customer specifications. COF current transformers can meet many applications for metering and protection with a number of dome sizes for up to three independent cores from 25 kV up to 170 kV.

SFP slots and suitable SFP modules provide connectivity over optical multimode or single mode fibers up to 80 km, both for Duplex LC (two fibers) and Simplex LC (bi-directional over one fiber). Several models provide Power-over-Ethernet ports (IEEE 802.3at / PoE+ and above).\n\nThe EDS500 managed switches for optical and copper Ethernet are certified for IEC 61850. The Ethernet/SHDSL switches support a variety of useful, reliable and intelligent functions, such as MSTP/RSTP/STP (IEEE 802.1Q/w/D), VLAN, IEEE 802.1X, HTTPS, SNMPv3, SSH, SCP, QoS, rate limiting, ACL/packet filter, RMON, LLDP, L2TP, IGMP snooping, ITU-T G.8032 ERPS ,and many more, making EDS500 suitable for any harsh industrial environment.\n\nConnectivity, guaranteed\nRead the infographic\nBenefits\nSeamless Connectivity\nHigh-level benefits of Hitachi Energy's EDS500 series devices include the capacity to handle mixed copper and fiber optic infrastructure with the same device(s), features, look and feel. Connecting copper (SHDSL) and fiber optics infrastructure with the same device provides a seamless transition from copper to fiber optics.\nPredictive Connectivity\nHitachi Energy EDS500 series devices provide predictive failure notification that detects, monitors, and analyzes network conditions that may result in severe errors and/or malfunctions and notifies users before conditions become critical. Predictive failure notification helps to convert unplanned downtime into plannable maintenance, reduces maintenance and service outage costs, and improves asset health.\nReliable Connectivity\nHitachi Energy EDS500 series devices process modern SCADA protocols. They can transport serial data, convert legacy (IEC-101 or Modbus RTU) into Ethernet based protocols (IEC-104 or Modbus TCP), use modern communication technologies for high availability and redundancy or monitor LAN and WAN connections via a SCADA protocol (using the SCADA control center).\nSimple Connectivity\nHitachi Energy EDS500 series devices support web-based approaches, command line interface, SNMP, and Syslog as well as human-readable configuration files that can be easily adapted. A memory stick is able to transfer, backup, and restore configurations to ensure a simpler and faster management and configuration process.\nLegacy Connectivity\nHitachi Energy EDS500 series legacy serial communication interface and behavior support gives customers a modern Ethernet-based network and communication function using existing low-quality cables, and is able to upgrade communication technology in an installation/substation without changing the end device, e.g. RTU and/or its configuration.\nOur offering\nEthernet communication products Serial communication products\n\nThe EDS500 managed Gigabit Ethernet switches distribute Ethernet with support of redundant topologies. Copper as well as fiber optical media are supported for WAN connections. Available copper lines can be reused for TCP/IP communication, allowing for an independent network for private communication. Additionally, transmission of serial data via RS-232 or PDH data via G.703 E1 interfaces allow for an easy migration from legacy technology to Ethernet communication. \n\nFlexibility and reliability of communication is a precondition for modern SCADA systems.

Using Phasor Measurement Units the WAMS can produce synchrophasors, or derived time-synchronized phasor values, to complete the picture of the functioning electricity grid. \n\nThe data in each PMU is time-synchronized via Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers – to an accuracy of one microsecond – and aggregated in the Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC) several times a second. The phasors measured simultaneously provide snapshots of the conditions at monitored nodes. By comparing these snapshots, the steady state, and also the dynamic state of critical nodes, can be observed across transmission and sub-transmission networks. \n\n\nRES670 is a Phasor Measurement Unit that provides power system AC voltages and currents as synchrophasors, providing real and imaginary parts or magnitude and phase angle.

Differential protection is based on Kirchhoff’s laws, stating that all current into a network node shall add up to 0 in an ideal system. What this practically means for a line protection application is that the current that is measured to flow into the line should also be measured to come out.\n\nWhat sounds as a trivial subtraction of outgoing current from ingoing current is in reality not trivial at all, since the power system is anything from an ideal system. Capacitive charging currents, non-transposed lines or asymmetrical communication causing phase rotation, drifting time synchronization, tapped lines and transformers are some examples of features that leak or transform current flowing on the line or influence the data sent from IED (Intelligent Electronic Device) to IED. It requires advanced stabilization methods to create a reliable line differential protection scheme.\n\n\nDifferential protection is easier to integrate into a protection philosophy as distance protection, as it is unit protection. It delivers more consistent performance, at the cost of increased hardware dependency. Some form of high bandwidth, low latency communication is required in between the line ends in order to exchange analog information for the line differential algorithm to process. Typically this is a direct fiber optic cable.\n\n\nIn order to cope with any situation, a modern protection IED needs to be configurable to fit within its intended application area. Hitachi Energy's solution to this requirement is the Relion series of IEDs. The Relion series offers a standardized library of the functionality on a high performance, common hardware architecture, and provides the flexibility and configurability to suit any application area.\n\n\nThe Relion 650 series differential protection IEDs include all required back-up functionality and the full power and flexibility of the Relion® platform.\n\n\nThe Relion 670 series differential protection IEDs improve upon the 650 series to fulfill more demanding applications, offering improved performance, increased customization options of hardware and software and allowing for increased functional integration and scalability.\n\n\nPSL 6603U is ideal as an alternative to the Relion series alternative offering, ultimately suitable as a main 2 solution as it uses a different hardware architecture and its own protection algorithms.

With excellent performance, flexibility and scalability they fulfill the demanding requirements of both new and retrofit installations – in every corner of the world.\n\nA generator protection system with REG650 meets the requirements for maximum dependability and availability. The internal/external fault discriminator is based on negative sequence quantities, enabling a fast and selective decision to operate. The unique main protection functions are able to selectively detect and clear all fault types over 100% of the stator winding. The stator earth-fault protection includes the evaluation of the fundamental and 3rd harmonic frequencies. The detection criteria can be used to create intelligent, application-specific functions to enhance your protection system to meet very specific requirements, for instance, when the operating conditions of the plant change.\n\nREG650 offers optimum ‘off-the-shelf’, ready-made solutions including all the required functionality for protecting small and medium-sized generators. With its 20 analog inputs, REG650 is one of the most compact generator protection devices on the market. This allows, for instance, the integration of overcurrent protection for excitation or auxiliary transformer, in addition to generator protection. The 3rd harmonic-based 100% stator earth-fault protection utilizes the differential principle, which provides high sensitivity and security. This ensures correct operation even during low load conditions.\n\nThe type-tested variants of REG650 IEDs are delivered equipped and configured with complete functionality and with default parameters for easy handling of products – from ordering, engineering and commissioning to reliable operation. Depending on the selected variant, either low impedance generator differential protection or three winding transformer differential protection is included. Other generator protection functions are always included.\n\nThe 650 series IEDs introduce a number of innovations, such as a significantly reduced number of parameter settings and extended IED HMI functionality including 15 dynamic three-color indication LEDs per page, on up to three pages, and five configurable push-button shortcuts for different actions. In the 650 series IEDs, the most basic parameters are set before delivery from the factory. You only need to set the parameters specific to your application.\n\nVersatile communication capabilities\n\nREG650 IEDs allow you to use several communication protocols in parallel to communicate with the plant control system, monitoring system, or relay protection engineering office.

Up to 24 analog inputs permit integration of main and back-up protection in one IED. Alternatively, additional objects, such as transformers, can be included in the generator protection scope. This enables full duplication of the protection in main one and main two. These features allow a reduction of the number of IEDs needed to protect the entire generating station, increasing availability at the same time. This, in turn, simplifies the installation and reduces its lifecycle cost as related to commissioning, maintenance, and spare parts. REG670 functionality also incorporates intelligent fault criteria, ensuring unrivaled selectivity and sensitivity.\n\nUsing an advanced and innovative filtering technique, REG670 can also provide integrated sub-synchronous resonance protection for turbo generators.   \n\nA generator protection scheme with REG670 meets the requirements for maximum dependability and availability. The generator differential protection features extremely fast detection criteria, with a typical operation time of 15 ms; while maintaining high security. \n\nAmong the many available functions, REG670 can include injection-based 100% stator and rotor earth-fault protection as well as 3rd harmonic based 100% stator earth-fault protection. These solutions enable a new way to optimize the cost-performance ratio of the protection system in relation to the importance or size of the generating station. Hitachi Energy's innovative implementation of the injection principle allows injection via a neutral point VT or even via an open-delta VT located at the generator terminals. As no changes need to be made in the primary circuit or in the grounding resistor, the design, installation, and commissioning of the protection system are easy and fast. The 3rd harmonic based 100% stator earth-fault protection utilizes the differential principle, which provides high sensitivity and security. This ensures correct operation even during low load conditions.\n\nRelion – Complete confidence\n\nGenerator protection REG670 and REG650 IEDs are members of the Relion protection and control product family. The Relion product family offers the widest range of products for the protection, control, measurement, and supervision of power systems.

Because of their specialized nature, traction power protection and control systems can be challenging.\n\nHitachi Energy's railway application intelligent electronic device (IED), Relion RER670, is used for the protection, control and monitoring of the transmission lines and/or transformers in a two-phase 16.7, 50 and 60 Hz power system design for railway supply. It supports isolated, compensated and solidly earthed networks.\n\nRER670's line protection covers distance protection functions providing high flexibility with quadrilateral or mho starting characteristic.\n\nOn the other hand, transformer protection covers transformer differential protection for two-phase to two-phase as well as two-phase to one-phase transformers. Besides the transformer differential protection, a wide range of backup functions are also available.\n\nA powerful functionality is this device's coverage for catenaries. Catenary distance protection is used as a distance protection for catenary feeders, which supply the moving locomotive through a pantograph.\n\nFurther, a very fast transformer tank protection helps to avoid damages in case of short circuits to the transformer tank.\n\nA wide range of control functions can also be included in RER670 to either complement the line or transformer protection IED with advanced control functions or to provide a control IED with optional backup protection.\n\nRER670 provides IEC 60870-5-103 as well as IEC 61850 Edition 2 communication to a substation automation system. While, in the case of IEC 61850 Edition 2, it also provides horizontal communication between IEDs.\n\nIn addition, this product provides extensive functionality ready to meet your specific requirements to transform your ever essential rail infrastructure into a much more reliable and future proof system.\n\nRail Solutions with Relion 670 series\nRead more\nOur offering\nRER670\n\nRailway\n\nRead more\nCustomer Success Stories\nLithuanian Railways electrifies East-West railway corridor to reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable economic development\nRead more\nGet to know more\nTechnical paper: Explaining the customer benefits of a flexible IED solution\nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

It also feeds auxiliary converters for other electrical systems like lighting, heating, and/or onboard information systems.\n\nIf the traction transformer fails, the planned train traffic schedule may be disturbed and leads to passenger inconvenience, and even costly penalties may be incurred.\n\nScope of work\n\nA traction transformer is highly reliable and designed to perform under harsh conditions. However, to prevent unpredicted failure and ensure a long lifetime, some services are advised during the whole life cycle.\n\nThe operating conditions of a traction transformer differ highly from power transformers. Therefore the interpretation of condition checks has to be done by traction experts; otherwise, misleading results may occur.\n\nRegular oil analysis gives a good image of the actual health. Additionally, basic and advanced diagnostic tests can provide further information.\n\nIf an onboard traction transformer gets damaged by an accident or due to other reasons, we are able to fully repair the traction transformer by replacing damaged parts of the core, winding reclamping, partial or full winding replacement, and repair of the tank. At the end of such work, all electrical routine tests are done.\n\nDuring the long lifetime of a vehicle, some operational conditions change. Upgrading or replacing some parts of the traction transformer can help ensure further operation.\n\nA midlife overhaul is recommended to ensure reliability in the second half of the lifetime. All traction transformers are systematically checked and maintained by replacing parts with lower lifetime expectancy.\n\nRelated Product Categories\nWorkshop Repairs for Distribution and Small Power Transformers\nHitachi Energy offers workshop repairs for distribution and power transformers ranging from 315 kVA to 5 MVA.\nLearn more\nWorkshop Repairs for Medium and Large Power Transformers\nHitachi Energy offers workshop repairs for medium and large power transformers.\nLearn more\nTransformer Refurbishment\nHitachi Energy offers refurbishment services to cover transformer rehabilitation and sustainable life extension to advance a sustainable energy future for all.\nLearn more\nOn-site Repairs\nHitachi Energy offers on-site repairs to bring the transformer factory setup to the work site with the TrafoSiteRepair™ service that is executed to the same high-quality standard as a workshop repair.\nLearn more\nTransformer Component Upgrades\nTransformers component upgrades are based on Hitachi Energy's decade-long experience in manufacturing and maintaining its products.\nLearn more\n24/7/365\nOur Global Service Teams are here to support you anytime!\nCustomer Connect Center\nGet to know more\nTransformer service\nAging assets, rising energy demand, and the critical need to avoid unplanned outages are challenging worldwide utilities and industrials.

Transient surges caused by lightning and switching operations in the system are limited by the MO arrester. If surges occur for a longer period of time (milliseconds to hours) due to faults in the system or for operational reasons, the thyristors fire to limit touch voltages. As soon as a zero-current transition occurs, the thyristors cut off the current flow and the original condition is restored. The whole device is molded in silicone, designed and tested according to EN 50122-1 (IEC 62128-1), EN 50123-5 (IEC 61992-5), EN 50526-1 (IEC 62848-1).\n\nVoltage limiting devices are used to prevent impermissible touch voltages in DC traction systems in normal operations and in fault conditions by bonding the return circuit of a DC railway system to the earthing system or to the exposed conductive parts.\n\nVoltage limiting devices are available for nominal triggering voltage 60 V and 120 V.\n \n\nApplications\nHVL compiles with both VLD-O (normal operation) and VLD-F (fault) functionality in the specified current range\nWhy Hitachi Energy?\nOver 100 years of experience in overvoltage protection and more than 30 years with silicone insulation\nLocal and global Hitachi Energy application support\nOwn production of metal-oxide (MO) resistors\nMechanically strong design\nUV resistant  silicone housing with excellent pollution performance\nVoltage limiting device HVL does not require power supply\nBrief performance data\n \t \tHVL-60\tHVL-120\nNormal triggering voltage\tV\t60\t120\nDC short-time withstand current at 100 ms - recoverable\tkA\t2.1\t2.1\nDC short-time withstand current at 100 ms - non-recoverable\tkA\t20\t20\nDischarge current (In)\tkA\t25\t25\nHigh current impulse with wave 8/20 µs\tkA\t80\t80\nHigh current impulse with wave 10/350 µs\tAs\t12\t12\n\n \n\nFor more details see the data sheet in downloads below.\n\nDownloads\nHVL voltage limiting device data sheet\nRead more\nData sheet: HVL 60\nRead more\nData sheet: HVL 120\nRead more\nSomething caught your eye?\n\nOur sales team will get in touch with you\n\nContact us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

Based on Hitachi Energy's silicone-housed PEXLIM arrester, together with line-hardware and an automatic disconnecting device, the PEXLINK concept offers secure and robust performance to improve line availability and security of electricity supply.\n\nThe PEXLINK concept enables a reliable power grid by providing transmission line protection for a disturbance-free system operation up to 800 kV\n\nApplications\nProtection of over-head lines \nLightning overvoltage protection \nSwitching overvoltage control\nIncreasing line availability and reliability\nCompact insulation lines\nUpgrade of transmission lines\nExtended station protection\nSubstitute for shield wires\nWhy Hitachi Energy?\nMinimum maintenance cost\nCustomizable mechanical and electrical design\nRobust installation hardware\nEasy to install\nWell-proven PEXLIM surge arresters\nAutomatic disconnecting device\nAdvanced wireless monitoring\nSafeguarding South African transmission network\nRead more\nProtecting extra-high-voltage transmission network in the United States\nRead more\nThe PEXLINK concept Applications NGLA EGLA 765 kV Advanced wireless monitoring\nImproving the reliability and availability of transmission lines\n\nPEXLINK is Hitachi Energy concept for improving transmission line reliability and availability by providing protection of line insulation. In addition to using our well-proven polymer-housed arrester PEXLIM along with additional accessories for fixing the surge arresters across the insulators the PEXLINK concept utilizes a special disconnecting device for automatic disconnection of the arresters in the event of an overload of the arresters. The PEXLINK concept is a simple, cost-effective and proven method of increasing the performance of transmission lines.\n\nThe PEXLINK concept has traditionally employed Non-Gapped Line Arresters (NGLA) for protection of transmission lines as such solution offers several important advantages. For the system voltage of 765 kV Hitachi Energy is now also able to offer an innovative Externally Gapped Line Arrester (EGLA) solution that provides the user with many unique benefits previously reserved for NGLA solutions only like switching control.\n\n\nUsing Hitachi Energy's standard PEXLIM arrester\n\n\nHitachi Energy's philosophy is to provide protection for line insulation at selected locations. The main element of the PEXLINK concept is the gapless silicone polymer-housed arrester PEXLIM with metal-oxide (MO) active elements. The PEXLIM surge arrester have been used for many years for protection of equipment in sub-stations and their superior protective performances are well-known.\n\nThe low weight of the PEXLIM arrester permits installation on existing structures and the polymer housing gives increased reliability of the line equipment as well as safety for people and animals which may be in the vicinity of the lines during overstress conditions\n\n\nDisconnecting Device\n\n\nTo ensure quick, safe, automatic and controlled disconnection of a failed arrester, Hitachi Energy uses a special disconnecting device and a suitable link in the ground circuit of the surge arresters.\n\nPEXLINK Concept Solution\n\n\nTo achieve optimal placement and selection for a PEXLINK installation Hitachi Energy provides a service in which we conduct computer simulations of transmission lines to determine optimal installation strategy: e.g. installation locations, tower configuration and  arrester stress level at each of the chosen locations along a transmission line. This approach will ensure that the installation strategy is cost-efficient whilst maximizing the performance improvements.\n\nGet to know more\nHigh-voltage surge arresters\nRead more\nHigh-Voltage Switchgear & Breakers\nRead more\nMedium-voltage surge arresters\nRead more\nSomething caught your eye?\n\nOur sales team will get in touch with you\n\nContact us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

In the design Hitachi Energy has chosen silicone polymer which is highly hydrophobic and resistant to UV radiation. \n\nEach arrester is built up of one or more units. Each unit is a polymeric housing containing a single column of ZnO disks, all individually extensively routine-tested during manufacture, dispersed with the necessary spacers as determined by the electrical design for the arrester. \n\nLong arresters often require (and are supplied with) external grading rings to maintain a uniform and acceptable voltage stress along their length.\n\nSilicone rubber is highly hydrophobic and resistant to UV radiation and has been shown to be the best insulation (compared to both porcelain and other polymers) based on worldwide independent laboratory and field tests. Hitachi Energy uses special fillers to enhance these properties as well as giving it high pollution resistance, tracking resistance and fire-extinguishing features. \n\nFor satisfactory performance, it is important that the arrester units are hermetically sealed. The HTV molding process under vacuum ensures this by efficient bonding between silicone and all internal parts along the entire length. Hence gaskets or sealing rings are not required.\n\nWhen the arrester is stressed in excess of its design capability the arrester is short-circuited and an internal arc is established. Thanks to the open cage design, the arc burns through the soft silicone material, thereby permitting the resultant gases to escape quickly and directly. At the same time, the aramide fibers keeps all internal parts together and prevent the expulsion of the internal components. Hence, special pressure-relief vents are not required for the PEXLIM design.\n\nThe color of the silicon is grey. Seaworthy packing of the arresters is standard.\n\nGet to know more\nHigh-Voltage Switchgear & Breakers\nRead more\nHigh-voltage surge arresters\nRead more\nMedium-voltage surge arresters\nRead more\nSomething caught your eye?\n\nOur sales team will get in touch with you\n\nContact us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

The higher flash point of these fluids substantially reduces the risk of fire.​\n\nTXpand™ rupture-resistant transformers\n\n \n\nStandard transformers are extremely rigid and strong structures, but when extreme pressure builds up due to internal failures, transformers can very rarely rupture, creating safety and environmental hazards.​\n\n \n\nTXpand™ is a new power transformer technology for rupture resistance, enhancing safety for people and the environment. Transformers containing this technology can literally expand, absorbing energy from faults.​\n\n \n\nTXpand™ uses a proven design and production experience with around 80 designs and over 160 units delivered.​\n\nDry bushings\n\n \n\nThe world’s most completed dry bushing portfolio enhances operational safety by fire and explosion-safe designs.

For example, up to 35% reduction of CO2 emissions from materials usage* is achieved (including carbon offsets from natural esters).\n\nUnited for Energy (U4E) – UN environment program​\n\nWe have partnered with the United Nations to provide our leading expertise on distribution transformers for their U4E global initiative, which aims to reduce transformer losses globally.​\n\nThe initiative’s ambitious goals estimate that 50 million tons of CO2 could be saved annually.\n\nRead more on U4E's goals\n\nRelated Product Categories\nEconiQ™ Transformers\n\nCo-creating for a sustainable energy future\n\nLearn more\nSafeguarding surrounding ecosystems\nMinimizing local impact\nLearn more\nEnhanced safety for people\nSafety is our priority\nLearn more\nResponsible use of resources\nDoing the most with what we have\nLearn more\nLife Cycle Analysis\nWe are with you from start to finish\nLearn more\nCustomer co-creation\nCollaborative sustainability journey\nLearn more\nGet to know more\nTransformers\nHitachi Energy offers distribution and power transformers, Dry-type and EconiQ™ Transformers as well as services, for industrial and commercial applications.\nVisit our webpage\nVisit our webpage\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

Since most ships operate with 60 Hz electricity whereas local grid in most parts of the world is 50 Hz, Hitachi Energy static frequency converters help to adjust the grid electricity to the appropriate ship frequency and are a viable solution in replacing vintage rotating frequency converters (motor/generator set).\n\nHitachi Energy frequency converters are an economic and efficient solution to convert the grid electricity to the appropriate frequency needed on board. Thanks to a complementary product portfolio consisting of ACS 6080 SFC, ACS 880 SFC and PCS 100 SFC we are able to offer adequate frequency converter solutions ranging from 100 kVA up to 27 MVA (higher power available when paralleling multiple converters).\n\nThe Hitachi Energy offering spans from frequency conversion engineered packages to comprehensive turnkey shore-to-ship power solutions from the connection to the public power grid to the installation on ships. \n\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

Rectifier diodes are generally used for conversion of AC (alternating current) to DC (direct current). While optimized for low conduction losses, Rectifier diodes withstand only moderate dynamic stress in transition from conducting to the blocking state.\n\nFast diodes, on the other hand, are companion devices to switches in DC to AC conversion. Every switch (GTO, IGCT or IGBT) requires a complementary diode (e.g. for \"free-wheeling\" reactive power) in order to enable operation of the DC-AC conversion system with inductive loads.\n\nFast diodes are optimized to accept high dynamic stress (fast transition from conducting to blocking state).

Although these components have high reliability, failures can occur due to external factors such as short circuits in the grid. Failures can also occur due to the aging effects of the active part, especially the insulation system, or the aging of important accessories such as bushings or on-load tap changers. In case of failure, the first action is to identify the type of failure. The aim is to localize the failure and its root cause.​\n​\nRepairing a transformer instead of replacing it can substantially reduce investment costs and provide a faster turnaround than buying a new transformer. Furthermore, to maximize the asset's technical life, a refurbishment or overhaul can be an intermediate action when no failure has occurred, and the aging of the active part has reached a stage where the continued reliability of the transformer is unacceptable.​\n\nUpgrade, repair, and extend services are frequently used options that can be performed either in an authorized service workshop or at the customer site. The reconditioned equipment undergoes complete testing and comes with a warranty.\n\n \n\n​\n\nWhy Hitachi Energy\nWith our base in manufacturing power and industrial transformers, we can upgrade or repair not only Hitachi Energy or legacy units but also perform reengineering of other makes for repair.​\nUsing our TrafoStar™ technology or re-winding as per specification, our stringent processes and quality requirements mean your transformer will be back in service in the minimum amount of time possible.​\nTo maximize your capital, tackle site constraints, or any other reason, we can repair, refurbish, or upgrade your unit based on your needs in a cost-efficient and sustainable way.\nBrowse our Upgrade, Repair, & Extend portfolio\nWorkshop Repairs On-site Repairs Refurbishment Component Upgrades\nWorkshop Repairs for Distribution and Small Power Transformers\nHitachi Energy offers workshop repairs for distribution and power transformers ranging from 315 kVA to 5 MVA.\nLearn more\nWorkshop Repairs for Medium and Large Power Transformers\nHitachi Energy offers workshop repairs for medium and large power transformers.\nLearn more\nWorkshop Repairs for Traction Transformers\nHitachi Energy offers workshop repairs for traction transformers to prevent unpredicted failure and ensure a long transformer life.\nLearn more\nRelated Product Categories\nParts & Maintain\nHitachi Energy offers genuine, high-quality spare parts along with basic and advanced maintenance services.\nLearn more\nAssess & Secure\nHitachi Energy offers online monitoring and asset management solutions, including diagnostic consulting services.\nLearn more\nEnCompass™ Agreements for Transformer Service\nHitachi Energy offers long-term EnCompass™ Agreements, which combine Transformer services in a modular and flexible way.\nLearn more\nSustain & Decarbonize\nHitachi Energy offers an eco-efficient portfolio of products, solutions, and services scientifically proven to deliver exceptional environmental performance.\nLearn more\n24/7/365\nOur Global Service Teams are here to support you anytime!\nCustomer Connect Center\nGet to know more\nTransformer service\nAging assets, rising energy demand, and the critical need to avoid unplanned outages are challenging worldwide utilities and industrials.

Snaking fiber-optic cables connect SCADA systems that monitor and manage the product delivery, but visualizing this second network requires a new breed of management tool – the SDM600.\n\nProtection relays do the vital work of monitoring the delivery network, but ensuring they’re all updated and properly configured has become increasingly burdensome, at least until the SDM600 takes on the job of tracking versions. Using IEC 61850 interfaces the SDM600 software keeps a watchful eye on protection relays so the user can ensure they’re all running the latest software, and to the greatest effect.\n\nSDM600 also talks to relays when collecting, and collating, fault records data. The gathered comtrade files are recorded into short reports for later analysis, while the SDM600 dashboard presents historical reports so we can see what happened and when with unprecedented ease. Authenticating users is another task which has ballooned as management networks grow in complexity, and one which SDM600 takes in its stride. Cybersecurity is a vital component in modern networks, but fragmented directory policies risk exposing critical vulnerabilities which SDM600 can avoid. With centralized security logging and central account management SDM600 becomes the gatekeeper to the automation network.\n\n\nKey Features\nData Management\n\nAutomatically collect, store, and provide evaluation for disturbance recorder files from Hitachi Energy or 3rd party products:\n\nDisturbance recorder data management\nDisturbance recorder data evaluation\nCybersecurity management\n\nProvide centralized user account management and security logging for Hitachi Energy and 3rd party products:\n\nCentral user account management\nCentral cybersecurity logging\n\nMaintenance and service\n\nRetrieve and manage Service or Maintenance relevant data from Hitachi Energy and 3rd party products:\n\nTracking software and configuration versions\nFleetwide management of firmware and configurations for Hitachi Energy RTU500 series\nLatest Release\nBLOG POST\nSDM600 1.3.5\n\nHitachi Energy recommends upgrading all existing SDM600 installations to SDM600 1.3.5.\n\n \n\nSDM600 1.3.5 introduces a cybersecurity dashboard which present statistics of cybersecurity events that are received by SDM600 in various views.

A traditionally centralized system with only a few big power producers is changing into a system containing many small producers, which directly feed into the local distribution grid. This can result in large voltage variations, an increased risk of the voltage exceeding the prescribed voltage range, and the need to limit or even interrupt the renewable generation.\n\nInnovative solution\n\nConventional solutions involve network upgrades – but a line voltage regulator (LVR) solves the problem quickly and economically. That's why Hitachi Energy offers LVRs for applications in the low-voltage (LV) grid and in the medium-voltage (MV) distribution grid. The LVR automatically adjusts a voltage, within a certain range, to a desired value. By applying Hitachi Energy LVRs, users avoid costly grid extension projects.\n\nWhy Hitachi Energy?\n\nThe Hitachi Energy line voltage regulators use a “booster/feeder“ technology in combination with mechanical switches. Energy losses are minimal. The voltage regulator is built with powerful Hitachi Energy components, and fulfils the highest environmental requirements.\n\nOur offering\nLine voltage regulator for low voltage grids\nRead more\nLine voltage regulator for medium voltage grids\nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

Such typical values are specified under EU EcoDesign product information for Tier 1 requirements.\n\nLoad loss and no-load loss values are maximum values with 0% upwards tolerance. If a value exceeds at factory routine testing the maximum value, the transformer is not compliant with the Regulation, and it is not allowed to use in the EU. \n\nNote that the values indicated for the weights depend on each specific transformer specification and may vary. The values also depend on the exact grade of electrical steel to be used. Transformer designs and materials used are constantly changing with changing materials prices. \n\nHitachi Energy can also provide transformers according to Tier 2 loss requirements and even lower losses. Hitachi Energy is the leading manufacturer of ultra-efficient transformers.

Applications range from large aluminum electrolysis to medium size operations. The transformers may have a built-in or separate voltage regulation unit.\n\nRegulating and rectifier transformer combinations that are applied to primary aluminum production (smelters) are commonly known as 'rectiformers'. A typical aluminum potline is built as a 60-pulse system with five parallel 12-pulse rectiformers, each with different phase-shift windings; a 60-pulse system can be achieved by the following phase shift angles: –12°, –6°, 0°, +6°, and +12°. As mentioned, one of the characteristics of rectiformers for aluminum plants is a very large regulating voltage range, from 0 volts up to potentially 2,000 volts (DC), depending on how many pots are connected in series.\n\n\nThe rectifier technologies employed in industrial applications are commonly known as double star (DSS) or double bridge (DB). DSS systems use an interphase transformer and are predominately applied as 6- or 12-pulse units where high currents are required with very low nominal voltages. DB systems are applied as 6-, 12-, 24-, 48-, or 60-pulse systems, as required to suit the harmonic mitigation and process stability requirements. A higher number of pulse groups can be applied but tend to be less commercially attractive\n\n\nRectiformers can be supplied as a single tank solution for applications up to a rating of approximately 160 MVA, but for larger ratings, transport limitations normally require that two transformers be supplied as separate units.\n\n \n\nProduct scope\n\nFor applications in excess of 2,000 VDC (>100 kA)\nInstalled base of over 20,000 MVA\nDouble star (DSS), Double bridge (DB)\n\nWhy Hitachi Energy\n\nAll knowledge under one roof within the Hitachi Energy Center of Excellence\nProven track record of more than 600 units built in the last 20 years\nHitachi Energy was the first company to design industrial transformers in 1885\nSomething caught your eye?\n\nOur sales team will get in touch with you\n\nContact us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

It’s the innovation that will drive our transition to clean energy. Innovation which will resolve the increasingly complex challenges of creating an environmentally stable world. And at Hitachi Energy, we never stop innovating.\n\nWe believe our latest innovation, the CompactCool™ technology, will unlock new applications for dry-type transformers. This is because CompactCool™ is a unique combination of safety, low maintenance, and reduced operating costs, all these with up to 50% smaller footprint than standard dry-type transformers.\n\nCombining the Best of Dry-Type and Liquid Cooling Mechanism\n\nDepending on the insulation technology, transformers are broadly segregated into two categories – dry-type and liquid-filled or liquid-immersed. In the latter, the insulation liquid also acts as a cooling agent to disperse or absorb heat generated by the windings. In dry-type transformers, the windings are air-cooled. While liquid-filled transformers bring advantages in terms of size and weight, losses & efficiency, noise, and overload capability to the table, dry-type transformers are preferred for fire safety, environmental safety, lower maintenance cost, and short circuit strength.\n\nBut what if there was an opportunity to get the best of both technologies in one single transformer type?\n\nHitachi Energy introduces the CompactCool™ technology for transformers which combines the advantages of both liquid-filled and dry-type cooling technology. CompactCool™ retains the benefits of a dry-type transformer while reducing transformer size, weight, and no-load losses as well as creating the ability to extract losses in an innovative and controlled manner.\n\nThis makes CompactCool™ ideal for data center and renewable energy segments, where factors such as optimized footprint, safety, and low maintenance are key to sustainable transformer operations.\n\nThe CompactCool™ technology combines dry-type solid insulation with direct liquid-cooling to deliver: \n\nHow it works\n\nCompactCool™ leverages an advanced cooling mechanism\nwhere a liquid coolant is used inside of the coils to extract the\nlosses out of windings and circulate them through an external heat exchanger.\nThe watts (heat) then get dissipated to an external ambience (to air or to a water\ncircuit supply). CompactCool™ does not require an enclosure unless it is requested by customers. \n\n \n\n \n\nWatch the video on how CompactCool™ works\nApplications for CompactCool™\n\nCompact form factor and smaller transformer footprint requirements are often seen as a challenge in sectors like renewable energy production. Wind industry transformers, for instance,  need to be installed on the ground floor of wind towers, on the first level, or inside of turbine nacelle platforms, where the available space for transformer installation is often limited. It is here where CompactCool™ technology creates a difference by solving the dimensional constraints of transformer installation while offering ease of logistics, footprint optimization, and reduced installation costs.\n\nDownload our CompactCool™ product brochure to know more\nimage 1\nImage 2\nImage 3\nPublished article: CompactCool™ - blending dry and liquid cooling transformer technologies\nRead the full article here\nWhy choose CompactCool™?\n\nThe reduction in footprint, which can be as much as 50%, unlocks endless possibilities for wind and solar power generation, easing logistics and lowering both space requirements and installation costs.\n\nWith 90% of losses captured when the transformer is 100% loaded, CompactCool™ technology installed in a data center can help to improve efficiency metrics by enhancing power usage effectiveness.\n\nOverall, the CompactCool™ technology from Hitachi Energy infuses safety and reliability into transformers through:\n\n\nOptimized cooling\nLow no-load losses\nMinimized volume of liquid coolant\n\nLow-cost maintainability and trouble-free operations\n\nWith CompactCool™ Technology, installing transformers in small enclosures or wind towers wouldn’t be an issue anymore.

An earthing transformer (neutral coupler) is a three-phase transformer connected to the power system to provide a neutral connection for earthing, either directly or via impedance. The earthing transformers may in addition supply a local auxiliary load.\n\nDuring single-phase faults, the reactor limits the fault current in the neutral and the restoration of the power line is improved.

If the load variation is slow, which it normally is (seasonal, daily, or hourly), a variable shunt reactor (VSR) could be an economical solution for some customer applications. VSR allows customers to continuously adjust the compensation, as loads vary over time.\n\nThey make switching in and out of fixed-rating reactors unnecessary, which eliminates harmful voltage steps. The variable reactor can always be adapted to the need, both in today’s operation and in the future grid. In addition, VSR can interact with other systems, such as static var compensators (SVCs) and high-voltage direct current (HVDC) links, in order to optimize the system operation and maximize dynamic capacity during failures.\n\nVSRs are, therefore, economical means to improve voltage stability and power quality under time-varying load conditions.

Instead of using conventional paper as spacer between the capacitive layers, the bushing's core is wound with synthetic fabrics. Both RIP and RIS bushings use epoxy resin as the main insulation material. The outdoor insulation for oil-air transformer applications, is made from silicone rubber material, extruded or molded directly onto the RIS condenser core. RIS bushings do not absorb water (no hygroscopic material like paper is used) and are, therefore, easier to store. At the same time, they share the same excellent fire-resistant, explosion-proof characteristics, and other advantages of traditional dry or RIP bushings.\n\nOur RIS bushings are available for AC transformers and reactors.\n \n\nWhy is Hitachi Energy your preferred partner?\n\nComplete range and outstanding performance under the most demanding conditions\n\nMany years of proven reliability in all continents\n\nState-of-the-art production facilities and 100 years of transformer components manufacturing experience\n\nFlexible design allows for adaptation to different customer needs and transformer requirements\n\nCompletely dry bushing, i.e., no oil spills, no explosion risk\n\nNo maintenance or constant monitoring is necessary\nTransport and storage is possible in all positions\nPartial discharge-free up to double service voltage\nLearn more\nNon-condenser Core Bushings\n\nHitachi Energy offers a complete range of non-condenser core bushings for reliably connecting distribution and power transformers.

This can be done with minimum changes to existing equipment while ensuring performance of the equipment and significantly lowering environmental impact.\n\n\nIn this process, SF6 from the installed gas-insulated lines is evacuated and filled into gas bottles for recycling or disposal and the GIL is then flushed to remove any humidity. The new eco-efficient gas mixture is then filled into the GIL and the switchgear is re-energized to connect back to the grid. The process is relatively quick and enables the reuse of passive gas components designed for SF6 to be converted into non-SF6 equipment, thereby improving their environmental and lifecycle performance.\n\nEconiQ is Hitachi Energy's eco-efficient portfolio for sustainability where products, services and solutions are proven to deliver exceptional environmental performance.\n\nApplications\n\nInstalled ELK-3, 420 kV gas-insulated lines\n\n\nWhy Hitachi Energy?\n\n\nOur solution is developed specifically to reduce the quantity of SF6 in installed high-voltage equipment without doing any major changes or upgrades on the existing equipment. All work can be performed without opening and dismantling the installed GIL. There is no need to change installed sealings, only gas is replaced.\nOur eco-efficient gas mixture significantly reduces the CO2 equivalent emissions as compared to SF6  while providing the identical ratings, same reliability and life cycle performance.\nExtensive GIS know-how and service support for smooth process in planning and execution at site.\n\nBenefits of EconiQ retrofill solution:\n \n\nConvert an existing GIL designed for SF6 to eco-friendly GIL without any dismantling and opening of gas compartment and with minimum outage.\nEliminate approximately 50% SF6 from the typical substation and thus reduces the carbon footprint and any financial and environmental implications thereof.\nReduce SF6 inventory from the network.\nFuture-proof solution to comply with environmental regulation changes.\nBrief performance data\n\nEconiQ retrofill for gas-insulated lines ELK-3, 420 kV\n\n\n\n\nCO2 equivalent relative reduction to SF6\n\n\t\n\n 98.8%\n\n\n\n\nRatings\n\n\t\n\nRated nominal voltage Um\n\n\t\n\n420 kV (440 kV 60min)\n\n\n\n\nPower frequency withstand voltage\n\n\t\n\n650 kV (r.m.s. value)\n\n\n\n\nRated switching / lightning impulse withstand voltage\n\n\t\n\n1,050 kV / 1,425 kV (peak value)\n\n\n\n\nRated current at 40 °C (50 Hz, 60 Hz)\n\n\t\n\n4,000 A\n\n5,000 A\n\n\n\n\nRated short time withstand current/duration\n\n\t\n\n63 kA / 3 s\n\n\n\n\nRated peak-withstand current (peak value)\n\n\t\n\n171 kA\n\n\n\n\nTemperature range\n\n \n\n \n\n\t-25° / +40 °C (+55 °C @ 4,000 A)\nGet to know more\nReplace SF₆ in existing high-voltage equipment with EconiQ retrofill\n\nYoutube\n\nWatch video\nHitachi Energy partners with National Grid on world’s first replacement of SF₆ in existing high-voltage equipment\n\nPress release\n\nRead now\nEconiQ retrofill for gas-insulated lines ELK-3, 420 kV\n\nProduct leaflet\n\nDownload\nAchieving the world’s first SF6 replacement with National Grid\n\nSuccess case\n\nDownload\nImplementation of a pioneering eco-efficient solution, EconiQ retrofill\n\nYoutube\n\nWatch video\nEconiQ retrofill: the sustainable solution for reducing green-house gas SF₆\n\nBlog\n\nRead more\nRelated offering\nEconiQ™ - Eco-efficient high-voltage portfolio\nGas-insulated switchgear (GIS)\nAir-insulated switchgear (AIS)\nSomething caught your eye?\n\nOur sales team will get in touch with you\n\nContact us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

This is done by means of high-power, high-voltage electronic semiconductor valves.\n\nA semiconductor valve is a device that can carry current in one direction only, and which prevents current from flowing in the opposite direction. This feature is essential for conversions of this type. Semiconductor valves are operated by a computerized control system, which enables transmitted power to be precisely controlled, a feature unique to HVDC systems. In AC transmissions, the power cannot be directly controlled, but depends on external factors.\n\n\nAn HVDC Light converter station is much smaller than a converter station for HVDC Classic. The HVDC Light semiconductor valves and converter reactors are placed inside, and DC and AC yards can be located in buildings on request.

Working together with our customers to better understand the environmental impact of these activities is a key pillar of our offering.\nWhile life cycle assessments (LCAs) introduce a product-oriented vision of the environmental impact that normally leaves the impact of maintenance activities and projects out of scope. They are far from negligible for our customers’ overall environmental footprint. Every small contribution matters. \n\n\nBeyond solving the energy trilemma, together.\nBeyond solving the energy trilemma, together.\nBeyond solving the energy trilemma, together.\nBeyond solving the energy trilemma, together.\nBeyond solving the energy trilemma, together.\n\nOur EconiQ™ Implementation services provide a detailed mapping of all your service and project activities’ CO2 equivalent emissions, increasing your awareness and optimizing execution to reduce or even avoid your impact, as well as compensating the remaining footprint.\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability\nImplementing strategies to reduce your carbon footprint to foresee a greener future, mitigating current environmental harm of your maintenance activities and fostering a sustainable tomorrow.\n\nReliability\nEnhancing energy security and securing reliability is one of our core values. Our offering includes solutions to allow our customers to boost their system reliability, addressing current and future system supply challenges.\n\nAffordability\nEnabling access to affordable and equitable energy through cost-effective solutions and innovative technologies, accelerating electrification, renewable integration, energy efficiency, among others.\n\nThree steps for a greener power system lifecycle\nThree steps for a greener power system lifecycle\nThree steps for a greener power system lifecycle\nThree steps for a greener power system lifecycle\nThree steps for a greener power system lifecycle\nStep 1: Calculate\n\nMeasure and evaluate your carbon footprint. Increase the awareness of your environmental footprint through a comprehensive assessment and report.\n\n\nUnderstand your activities and their impact\nWe are committed to minimizing your environmental impact and specifically the impact of the actions we provide to you with our services, from the definition to the execution of the works.\n\n\nIdentify emission hotspots through the environmental report generated\nWith the calculations made, Hitachi Energy will generate a report containing all the details of your project and the environmental impact associated with it by category, such as equipment, construction, shipping, and traveling, among others. This report will identify the emission hotspots of your services activities.\n\nDefine data-driven greener strategies\nHaving access to this data and the possibility of comparing various scenarios will allow you to define more efficient, data-driven strategies for carbon footprint improvement.\n\nStep 2: Cut\n\nOnce the impact of all activities has been analyzed, our experts can suggest alternatives on how to implement more sustainable maintenance activities to your power system by wisely choosing products and actions having lower environmental impact.\n\nMore sustainable products and materials\nWhen designing a maintenance activity, spare parts and replacement of core products have a strong impact on the overall environmental footprint. In this context, our EconiQ™ product portfolio offers you more environmentally friendly assets (SF6-free high-voltage products, transformers with less pollutant oils, etc.). Avoiding a 100g SF6-leakage is equivalent to eliminating 2 tCO2 equivalent emissions.\n\nPreventing unnecessary activities\nPreventing unnecessary activities is one of the pillars of an efficient and sustainable maintenance strategy. After carefully considering whether a maintenance activity of a particular asset is even necessary, the next step is to think about how you can reduce the frequency of that task or if you can perform it more efficiently. This will lead to cutting the environmental impact of existing and future maintenance activities. For example, our analysis show that eliminating a small avoidable maintenance activity can result in approximately 0.5 – 1 tCO2 equivalent emission reduction.\n\nExecute with a smaller footprint\nBuilding on our domain expertise in the field and our large installed base, together we will evaluate the alternatives to execute site activities tasks more efficiently. To do so, we will examine using smart shipping strategies, finding alternatives to on-site interventions, and using digital technologies as much as possible to optimize maintenance strategies. Our analysis show that for short maintenance activities, traveling is sometimes the major contributor to the carbon footprint. Every time we avoid a flight from America to Europe using augmented reality support, we are saving more than 0.5 tCO2 equivalent emissions.\n\nStep 3: Compensate\n\nHitachi Energy offers carbon neutral and net-zero services, by adding compensation solutions to previous quantification and reduction strategies. Thanks to our key collaborations, we can now capture the CO2 emitted.\n\nCO2 offset\nOffset strategies create a compensation of the same amount of carbon emissions due to a specific service or activity. Carbon offsets are achieved by actions such as promoting renewable sources for energy development or tree-planting programs that balance the environmental impact of services provided.\n\nCO2 capture\nCapture strategies seek to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. This is achieved by capturing CO2 directly from the atmosphere.

Since the transmitted load often varies considerably from one hour to the next, the reactive power balance in a grid varies as well. This can result in unacceptable variations in voltage amplitude, including voltage depression or even voltage collapse.\n\nLike a Static Var Compensator (SVC), the STATCOM instantly and continuously provides variable reactive power in response to voltage transients, supporting the stability of grid voltage. The STATCOM operates according to voltage source principles, combining unique switching of high-power semiconductors like IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors) and IGCTs (Integrated Gate Commutated Thyristors).   The use of these powerful components means the STATCOM`s footprint can be extremely small, and Hitachi Energy has branded this high-performance STATCOM concept SVC Light®.\n\n\nInstalling a STATCOM at one or more suitable points in a grid will increase power transfer capability by enhancing voltage stability and maintaining a smooth voltage profile under different network conditions. The STATCOM also enables improvements in power quality in heavy industry like steel-making. \n\nSVC Light® technology\n\nSVC Light® is based on a technology platform also used in high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission applications, namely HVDC Light®. The most important component is the modular voltage source converter (VSC), equipped with powerful semiconductors performing switching. SVC Light is available for system voltages up to 69 kV and converter ratings over -/+ 400 Mvar. For higher voltages, a step-down transformer is used to connect SVC Light to the grid. SVC Light provides a symmetrical operating range. For asymmetrical operations and in order to optimize performance, thyristor-switched reactors and capacitors are operated in parallel to form hybrid solutions.\n\nSVC Light® principle\n\nSVC Light is a VSC concept, based on a chain-link modular multilevel converter (MMC), particularly adapted for power system applications. Physically, SVC Light can be considered a voltage source behind a reactance. It generates and absorbs reactive power by electronically processing voltage and current waveforms in the VSC, rendering unnecessary to include physical capacitor and reactor branches for generating/absorbing reactive power.  It is capable of yielding a high reactive power input to the grid more or less unimpeded by possible suppressed grid voltages, and with a high dynamic response.\n\nThis is particularly useful, for instance, to support weak grids and to improve the performance of large wind farms under varying grid conditions, as well as of grids loaded by a large percentage of air conditioners in hot and humid climates. SVC Light´s effective rating and speed of response is unequalled. For instance, for high-speed rail systems and heavy industrial plants it is applied for voltage balancing of asymmetrical loads, mitigating voltage flicker created by electric arc furnaces, and active harmonic filtering.  \n\nThe power semiconductors (IGBT/IGCT) are key components in SVC Light. The multilevel chain-link solution is built up by linking H-bridge modules in series with one another to form the phase legs of the VSC. Fig. 1a shows a single H-bridge with four IGBTs, and Fig. 1b shows a configuration in which four H-bridge modules make up each of the three phase legs.  A photograph of modular H-bridge units, two stacks of four modules each, is displayed in Fig. 2. The compactness of the IGBT valves, the absence of physical capacitor and reactor branches for generating/absorbing reactive power, plus the minute need for harmonic filters enable a very compact lay-out of SVC Light.\n\nFig. 1: Multilevel chain-link converter setup\nFig. 2: Modular H-bridge units\nRelated offering\nSTATCOM - Hybrid\nRead more\nSTATCOM - PCS6000\nRead more\nReferences\nHybrid STATCOM for Borken substation, Germany\nRead more\nZhangjiagang plant, Eastern China\n\n \n\nRead more\nSomething caught your eye?\n\nOur sales team will get in touch with you\n\nContact us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

The PCS 6000 converters are based upon a standard IGCT PEBB, which allows systems to be realized with lower engineering and design costs. The innovative connection configuration allows for very good harmonic performance with typically no need for a harmonic filter.\n\n \nTime savings\n\nHitachi Energy has ensured that the design concept of the modular container system reduces on site construction time to a minimum. The converter equipment is pre-assembled and tested to the highest standards and is shipped to site as a container package ready for immediate installation. Thanks to the high degree of standardization, the defined interfaces on site commissioning work can be reduced to a minimum. Due to the modular design, the system can even be relocated to a new site within a short time.\n\nThe PCS 6000 STATCOM solution is virtually maintenance free, due to the minimized number of moving mechanical parts. Outages for inspection can therefore be scheduled according to the customer’s needs and preferences.

Hitachi Energy STATCOM, under the brand name of SVC Light®, is based on chain-link modular multilevel (MMC) voltage source converters (VSC), particularly adapted for power system applications. It is capable of providing high reactive power in grids more or less unimpeded by suppressed voltages, and with a high dynamic response. Further development has combined VSC technology with that of thyristor-based SVC (Static Var Compensator), combining the best of both technologies and offering joint benefits by incorporating Thyristor Switched Capacitors (TSC) and Thyristor-Switched Reactors (TSR) to create a Hybrid STATCOM solution.\n\nIn general, STATCOM comes into the picture where available space in substations is scarce, the reactive power output needs to be controllable more or less independent of the AC system voltage, or a speed of response is desired one order of magnitude greater than what is possible with thyristors. Also, VSC based solutions are less sensitive and dependent on network conditions. Harmonic filters in classic SVCs are a weak point, as their performance depends entirely on the harmonic impedance of the network.\n\n\nSTATCOM in itself provides a symmetrical operating range. For asymmetrical operation and in order to optimize performance, Hybrid STATCOM may be the best solution, in particular for very large Mvar operation ranges.  In these cases, the STATCOM power can be supplemented by thyristor switched branches to attain the desired Mvar output. TSR (Thyristor Switched Reactor) provides extension of the inductive range, whereas TSC (Thyristor Switched Capacitor) provides extension of the capacitive range of the device. By means of fast switched thyristor valves in joint operation with the VSC, TSR and TSC enable rapid, repeated and transient free switching of reactive elements (reactors and capacitors).   \n\n Hybrid STATCOM offers easy extension of dynamic range, lower total losses, and superior contingency handling.\nAdding a TSR branch gives superior overvoltage performance.\nWith a TSC branch, fast blocking can be applied to prevent overvoltage after fault clearing.\n\nMultilevel VSC based STATCOM has low harmonic generation. As neither TSC nor TSR add any harmonics to the picture, Hybrid STATCOM has low harmonic generation, too. As a benefit, no low order harmonic filters are required in the installation.\n\nSTATCOM as well as Hybrid STATCOM for power transmission applications normally make use of a power transformer between the grid and the medium voltage busbar. On this bus the VSC is connected in series with a coupling reactor. In addition, in the Hybrid case, TSR and TSC are added in parallel.\n\nFig. 1: Single Line Diagram example of a Hybrid STATCOM with one TSR and one TSC branch\nRelated offering\nSTATCOM - SVC Light®\nRead more\nStatic Var compensation (SVC)\nRead more\nSomething caught your eye?\n\nOur sales team will get in touch with you\n\nContact us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

A common initial application utilizing the AMI network is centralized meter reading. This single application provides the utility with many benefits that result in reduced operating costs, improved operational efficiencies, and greater customer satisfaction.\n\nTypically an AMI communications network is multi-tiered. Often an RF mesh is used for the tier 3 network, to connect smart meters to a metering collector. The tier 2 field area network provides backhaul of metering collectors to substations that connect to the tier 1 core IP network which then connects to the utility’s head-end system.\n\nIn addition to reading meters, many utilities are embarking on AMI plus, leveraging their AMI communications network to aggregate communications for a variety of applications beyond meter reading. Examples of these applications including remote service connect/disconnect, prepay services, demand-response, time-of-use pricing, power quality monitoring, outage management and more. However, as AMI plus applications are deployed, they place incremental demands upon the tier 2 AMI backhaul network for bandwidth, latency and reliability. Many utilities, will need to migrate their tier 2 network to a more robust communications network that meets these more demanding needs.\n\nAMI in smart grid\n\nHitachi Energy offers high-performance broadband, narrowband and cellular solutions that can work together to provide utilities with an optimal end-to-end communications network that enables a wide range of smart grid applications and a foundation for the future.\n\nWireless Communications for Utilities\n\nAMI Benefits\nCentralized meter reading reduces operational costs\nIt reduces truck rolls thereby reducing fuels and vehicle maintenance costs; increases meter reading accuracy; enables more timely identification of unaccounted for energy losses.\nEnables more frequent meter reading\nIt helps the utility to better understand power demand enabling them to improve planning; data helps customers understand their own usage and identify ways to conserve.\nRemote meter control\nIt enables new applications such as centralized connect/disconnect of power to customers, reducing service response time; automation of peak demand load shedding can reduce the risk of a power outage.\nDemand response can shift power usage during peak periods helping balance supply and demand\nA variety of programs can be offered such as time-of-use rates (time-of-use pricing, critical peak pricing, variable peak pricing, real-time pricing, and critical peak rebates); direct load control programs which provide the ability for utilities to cycle air conditioners and water heaters on and off during periods of peak demand in exchange for a financial incentive and lower electric bills.\nApplications\nApplication datasheet\nRead more\nLeased line replacement\nRead more\nSubstation Automation Systems\nRead more\nCustomers Success Stories\nAvista\nRead more\nSilicon Valley Power Customer Success Story\nRead more\nGlendale Power & Water Customer Success Story\nRead more\nRock Hill, South Carolina Customer Success Story\nRead more\nCorpus Christis, Texas Customer Success Story\nRead more\nWellington, Florida Customer Success Story\nRead more\nLinks & downloads\nWhitepapers\nComparison of Licensed and Unlicensed Spectrum for Utility-Owned Distribution Area Communication Networks\nNetworking the smart grid\nUsing wireless communication networks to enable outage management\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

Teleprotection systems were developed alongside the electrical grids themselves, and the operational communication networks used are mainly driven by those applications. In 1940, the average telephone user was just getting to grips with the rotary-dial telephone, while Hitachi Energy was deploying power-line communications: utilizing the electrical transmission infrastructure to carry teleprotection data and avoiding the need for a separate Pilot Line.\n\nPublic telecom networks have evolved at an amazing speed, this has been primarily driven by new applications (e.g. smartphones, YouTube, email) which results in a growing demand for increased bandwidth. Subsequently this has resulted in network solutions with a higher capacity for data transmission with a lower focus upon the quality of service. Teleprotection systems, in contrast, have always operated under the pressure of protecting critical infrastructure. Reliability and quality of service is paramount, resilience is required, while new technologies and techniques must prove themselves robust enough to match, or exceed, the existing equipment before they can safely be used in the electrical network.\n\nTo learn more about FOX615, download the new brochure and the datasheet BIGO1 - IEC 61850 proxy gateway interface unit.\n\nInterface modules\nMPLS-TP Core Units\nEthernet/IP\nLegacy Data\nTelephony\nTeleprotection\nSecurity & Encryption\nGet to know more\nFOX615 Multiservice Platform\nDownload brochure\nTeleprotection Solutions\nDownload brochure\nFOX615 Modular System Family\nDownload brochure\nRelated offering\nFOX515\nRead more\nFOX515H\nRead more\nFOX605\nRead more\nFOX660\nRead more\nFOXMAN\nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

Physical security requires a reliable, secure, high-performance communications network between security devices (sensors, cameras, key pads, lights, etc.) and computers located in the utility’s operations center.\n\nAdding network communications to existing substations to extend reach to the various security devices around the yard is often physically or financially prohibitive. As wireless networks require no trenching, they are typically the most cost-effective solution for existing substations. Some of the physical security applications commonly used are video surveillance cameras; access control using biometrics, keypads, etc.; perimeter sensors that detect thermal/motion; and gunshot detection, alerting and location identification.\n\nSubstation physical security benefits for utilities include:\nDeters malicious activity\nServing as evidence for prosecuting perpetrators.\nReduces potential safety risks and damage\nFrom the malicious activity, vandalism, and theft with an early alert of unauthorized substation access, which could result in physical or cybersecurity damages.\nLogging of authorized personnel\n Entering and exiting the facility provides accountability and can improve worker safety.    \nReduces truck rolls\nEnhancing situation awareness and increases operational efficiency and worker safety with the ability to monitor the physical protection of substations remotely.\nReliable and resilient communications\nLying as the foundation for NERC CIP-014-1\n\nHitachi Energy offers high-performance broadband, narrowband and cellular solutions that can work together to provide utilities with an optimal end-to-end communications network that enables a wide range of smart grid applications and a foundation for critical infrastructure protection.\n\nApplications\nLeased Line Replacement\nDownload brochure\nSubstation Automation\nLearn more\nLinks & downloads\nWhite Paper: Using wireless communication networks to enable outage management\nRead More\nRelated offering\nWireless Networks\nRead more\nNetwork Management System\nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

TeleOS radios provide power-efficient SCADA communications with integrated I/O capabilities. Using TeleOS, industrial customers, electric utilities and upstream oil and gas companies can implement wireless communications to remote locations (plants, substations or off-grid well pads), reducing capital and operational expenses, helping maximize oil production efficiency, and enhancing environmental and worker safety.\n\nProviding higher-bandwidth wireless communications to dispersed remote locations had been challenging because the power consumption of traditional broadband networking equipment has exceeded the capacity of local generation facilities such as solar panels with batteries and thermoelectric generators. Operators face the dilemma of either funding an expensive expansion of local generation capabilities for modern wireless communications, or using narrowband PTMP radios systems that lack the reliability, security and performance required to support contemporary applications.\n\nPower efficient TeleOS products bridge the gap, offering 10 to 50 times higher throughput than traditional narrowband radios, yet the cost of powering a TeleOS radio is less than half the cost of powering a broadband radio. With higher throughput than narrowband SCADA radios, TeleOS enables more frequent polling of measurement from automation devices, resulting in higher resolution data and enhanced decision-making capabilities. IP support and enterprise-class security enable TeleOS networks to be integrated with corporate IT networks, supporting faster business decision making and implementation.\n\nTeleOS radios include one or two 10/100BASE-T wired interfaces to provide connectivity for state-of-the-art equipment. The units’ serial interfaces as well as their optional analog and digital input/output (I/O) capabilities support direct connections to sensor equipment. These communication capabilities support vital activities such as electric distribution, water treatment and injection, as well as emergency shutdown (ESD) procedures.\n\nThe TeleOS point-to-multipoint architecture can be implemented together with the TropOS broadband mesh products, both technologies managed by the Supros network management system. Featuring an intuitive web-based interface. Supros is a powerful, standards-compliant network management system that enhances the efficiency of IT personnel by simplifying complex tasks such as wireless mesh network performance analysis and system optimization. \n\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

It is configurable for single- or multi-phase coupling with band-pass or high-pass filtering characteristic. MCD80 devices conform to the latest IEC-and ANSI standards.\n\nIn spite of the growing use of digital communication systems - especially those employing optical fiber links for which Hitachi Energy produces a comprehensive line of equipment - PLC is still often the most cost-effective, and reliable, solution to cover the operational needs of a power system. This applies particularly when only low volumes of data have to be transmitted over long distances.\n\nAn existing PLC network represents a considerable investment made over many years, and for reasons of cost and system operation, it is seldom possible, or necessary, to replace it with a digital system in a short space of time. An existing PLC network can often be usefully expanded rather than replaced, and in such cases, frequency allocation must be carefully planned to mitigate any channel shortage.\n\nIn other instances a PLC channel is used as a back-up to fiber-based digital channels, providing a dependable communication link in the most demanding of circumstances.\n\nWith decades of successful involvement in the PLC and transfer tripping field, Hitachi Energy continues to prove its high technical standards and competence by remaining at the forefront of PLC development. Hitachi Energy provides the latest technologies to PLC systems, with five-step variable bandwidth and flexible partitioning of digital and analog data, backed with a formidable capability in systems and applications engineering.\n\nOur Offering\nETL600 R4\n\nPower Line Carrier Equipment\n\nRead more\nMCD80\n\nCoupling Filter\n\nRead more\nRelated offering\nWireless Networks \nRead more\nNetwork Management Suite \nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

As a consequence, it may be necessary to inspect the internal components for signs of abnormal operation. Hitachi Energy's TXplore™ accomplishes an internal inspection examining the structure of the transformer without the need to remove the oil and send an inspector into the confined space of a power transformer.\n\nUsing the TXplore™ system avoids the danger of a spill when handling the oil and the risk of sending someone inside the transformer to perform an inspection. This can be accomplished during a brief outage versus conventional inspections requiring multiple days. Also, when a traditional internal inspection is complete, significant cost savings is accomplished by avoiding the oil handling and processing equipment needed to remove the oil and reprocess and fill the transformer.\n\nTXplore™ service can be scheduled ahead of time to take advantage of a planned outage with little or no increased downtime. It is also possible to deploy the service team to perform an inspection when unexpected issues are encountered.\n\n\nProduct scope\nUse on any oil-filled power transformer\nCompatible with mineral or ester fluids\nEliminates the risk of a person entering the confined space environment\nInspection can begin immediately after taking an outage\nSignificant reduction in outage time\nNo, or very little, oil needs to be handled\nEliminates the need for a confined space rescue team\nWhy Hitachi Energy?\nNear real time images are available to Hitachi Energy transformer experts\nAs issues are identified, experts from around the world can provide diagnostic support\nA report is provided to customers when issues place the transformer at risk with solutions to improve reliability\nUnknown condition is identified with high quality images and expert review\nRelated Product Categories\nParts & Maintain\nHitachi Energy offers genuine, high-quality spare parts along with basic and advanced maintenance services.\nLearn more\nUpgrade, Repair, & Extend\nHitachi Energy offers customized solutions to extend the life of your transformers.\nLearn more\nAssess & Secure\nHitachi Energy offers online monitoring and asset management solutions, including diagnostic consulting services.\nLearn more\n24/7/365\nOur Global Service Teams are here to support you anytime!\nCustomer Connect Center\nGet to know more\nTransformer service\nAging assets, rising energy demand, and the critical need to avoid unplanned outages are challenging worldwide utilities and industrials.

Aging assets, rising energy demand, and the need to deliver without unplanned outages are some of the challenges utilities and industries are facing today around the world.\n\nFixing these challenges means that new solutions are needed to maintain the installed base of assets as well as when refurbishing, repairing, or upgrading legacy transformers. Since the late 90s, Hitachi Energy has offered a modular three-step approach to a Condition-Based Maintenance or Reliability Centered Maintenance program:\n\n\nStep 1. Fleet screening survey: A quick scan of a large population (20 to 200 units) collects easily accessible data, such as unit nameplate data, oil and dissolved-gas-in-oil data, load profile, history of the unit, and sister units.\n\n\nStep 2. Condition assessment: At this stage, transformer design experts focus on a smaller number of units (10 to 20) identified in step 1. They use modern design rules and tools to evaluate the original design. Advanced diagnostic tests are performed to assess each of the principal properties of the transformer in a structured way. This assessment leads to an estimate of each transformer`s risk of failure and defines action plans to improve the reliability of each unit.\n\nStep 3. Expertise: The number of units to be further analyzed is typically limited to two or three out of a population of 100 units. This third module of the assessment process provides accurate information with respect to overloading transformers, enhancing their performance (power or voltage increase), or extending their lifetime.\n\nOur service offerings assess the operational condition of transformers, provide recommendations to mitigate risks, and enhance the performance of aged equipment to meet possible new requirements. It also provides state-of-the-art information on online monitoring solutions, maintenance, and repair options to be used to ensure reliable operating conditions.\n\n \n\nWhy Hitachi Energy\nWith our Condition-Based Maintenance Program, control maintenance costs can be optimized while achieving highly reliable power delivery.\nUsing the Mature Transformer Management Program (MTMP™), units at Risk of Failure and units requiring further attention and actions are singled out.\nWith screening, capital expenditure can be steered to units most in need, and the investment plan can be evaluated for different service options in a pre-set time frame (e.g., 2012 to 2042).\nScope of work\nMature Transformer Management Program™ (MTMP™)\t\n\nIt is three steps approach that can be applied to a single or fleet of transformers. The steps include fleet screening, design and condition assessment, and life assessment /profiling of the transformer fleet. The reports provide each transformer's condition and life assessment with recommendations for further action in order to minimize or eliminate the risk of failures.\n\nFor more information on MTMP™, please download the leaflet below:\n\nMTMP™ Transformer Condition Assessment (Leaflet, pdf, 0,36 MB)\n\nBasic Diagnostics Testing\t\n\nVisual Inspection, Standard Oil Test (SOT), Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA), Furan Analysis, Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB), Copper Sulphide (Cu2S), Standard and Special Tests\n\n \n\n\nAdvance Diagnostics Testing\t\n\nAdvanced Dissolved Gas Analysis (ADGA), Frequency Response Analysis (FRA), On-Load Tap Changer Vibration Diagnostic, Dielectric Frequency Response (DFR), Partial Discharge Analysis (PDA)\n\nFor more information on Advance Diagnostics Testing, please download the leaflet below:\n\nTransformer Lifetime Management (Leaflet, pdf, 0,33 MB)\n\nTrafoSiteTesting™\t\n\nHigh-voltage testing, including applied and induced testing with Partial Discharge measurement on-site.\n\nFor more information on TrafoSiteTesting™, please see the links below:\n\nTrafoSiteTesting™ web page\nTrafoSiteTesting™ (Leaflet, pdf, 0,43 MB)\nTrafoSiteTesting™ - Impulse Testing – Lightning and Switching (Leaflet, pdf, 2,39 MB)\n\nTXLife - Bushing Diagnostics Package\t\n\nOur bushing diagnostics package includes required inspection and testing to determine the condition of your bushings accurately, providing early warning of failure and enabling proactive replacement planning.

The level of possible contamination of the insulating oil over the years depends on its design, especially on the effectiveness of the oil preservation system and sources of contamination.\n\n\nBy sampling and analyzing the dielectric fluid, contaminants can be detected, and appropriate preventative actions initiated. The Oil and Gas Analysis remains a critical component of the condition assessment of the transformer.\n\n \n\nWhy Hitachi Energy\nCombining the latest test technology and equipment with a century of design knowledge and expertise ensures reliable test reports and recommendations.\nBy translating the test data into actionable information and recommendations, an informed decision can be taken on how to tackle the condition of the transformer.\nService solutions aimed at addressing problems with the transformer, such as Oil Filtration, Oil Reclamation, and Vapour Phase Drying (VPH), are readily available.\nScope of work\nMethods to assess the quality of the transformer oil:\nDielectric breakdown strength\tThis test measures the voltage at which the oil electrically breaks down and provides a good indication of the amount of contaminants.\nInterfacial tension\tThis test determines the interfacial tension between the oil sample and distilled water.\nAcid neutralization number\tThis test helps to determine the acid number or acidity of the oil, which can be caused by the oxidation process of the insulation forming acids and sludge formation.\nPower factor\tThis test helps to indicate the dielectric loss leakage current of the oil.\nFuran analysis\tThis test helps to understand the paper degradation rate.\nPCB content\tThis test determines the PCB content in the oil and if it meets local environmental regulations.\nCorrosive Sulphur CCD test\tA new test was developed to identify oil that may have caused copper sulfide precipitation in cellulosic insulation.\nDissolved Gas Analysis DGA\tThis test helps to analyze the gasses dissolved in the oil, and this test has been used to detect faults or to investigate the cause of the failure.\n\n \n\nUsing our global reach, we support many customers worldwide in the collection of oil samples, the oil and gas analysis in our certified oil laboratories, as well as providing a first analysis of the unit's health status. Combining this with our extensive design knowledge as well as repair/refurbishment know-how accumulated over the years, we can present a more comprehensive report with appropriate recommendations to prolong the usage of the transformer.\n\nOnline oil regeneration has technical and economic advantages when applied to old transformers with aged, acidic oil. The process is more environmentally friendly than oil replacement and demonstrates much better efficiency over the long term. This is a very efficient alternative to passivation since it enables the definitive removal of corrosive compounds from corrosive oils, thus avoiding the risk of copper sulfide formation.\n\nRelated Product Categories\nEngineering and consulting\nHitachi Energy's engineering and consulting identify opportunities and solutions to improve system and equipment performance and regulatory compliance with reference to planning and specifications.\nLearn more\nTXplore™ transformer inspection robot\nHitachi Energy's TXplore™ accomplishes an internal inspection examining the structure of the transformer without the need to remove the oil and send an inspector into the confined space of a power transformer.

It monitors the current and the thermal load of the surge arrester. In case of a thermal overload, it interrupts the current flow and disconnects the surge arrester thus preventing any arcing, sparking or ejection of hot particles that may have the potential to start a wildfire.\n\nWhen operated, SPU gives an indication that is easily visible from the ground level, so that the arrester can be replaced upon visual indication. However, such an operation means the protective function of surge arrester cannot be performed and thus the line equipment are exposed to the risk unless the arrester and SPU are identified and replaced. To make this process of monitoring easier, SPU can also be equipped with a wireless monitoring device.\n\nMedium-voltage surge arresters equipped with SPU from Hitachi Energy are approved for vegetation clearance exemption according to CalFire (California Regulation). They are also considered spark-free according to class A of Australian Standard AS 1307.2.\n\nWireless SPU indicator\n\nThe Wireless SPU indicator can be assembled around the SPU, and can transmit the information about the the status of the SPU (operational or tripped), its geographical location, the time of the tripping event as well as the status of its batteries to customer over long-range wireless communication network, to facilitate better planning of maintenance and replacement of devices.\n\nApplications\n \n\nFor use with Hitachi Energy surge arresters in medium-voltage distribution networks\nEspecially made for areas with risk of wildfires\nFor remote areas which are difficult to access for line inspection or are irregularly inspected\n\n\nWhy Hitachi Energy?\n \n\nOver 100 years of experience in overvoltage protection\nUnique and patented design\nInhouse production of metal-oxide (MO) resistors\nApproved for vegetation clearance exemption according to CalFire regulation\nEasy to install\nLocal and global Hitachi Energy application support\nBrief performance data\n \t \nNominal Discharge Current In\t10 KApeak\nHigh Current Impulse Ihc (4 / 10 μs)\t100 kApeak\nService conditions:\t \nAmbient air temperature Tamb\t−40 to +55 °C\nAltitude\tup to 1800 m (for higher altitudes contact Hitachi Energy)\nFrequency of system voltage\t40 to 62 Hz\nWireless indicator details\t \nCommunication\tLoRaWAN\nCommunication range\t\n\nUp to 5 km in urban areas\n\nUp to 15 km in rural areas\n\nKnow more\nPart of category\nPress Release\n30-11-2022 | 2 MIN READ\nHitachi Energy launches digital wildfire prevention technology for a resilient grid\nRead more\nVideo: Wireless indicator for Spark Prevention Unit (SPU)\nWatch the video\nBBC Humanising Energy: Fighting wildfires with innovation in Australia\nWatch the film\nPerspective: Improving grid resilience in the face of wildfires\nRead more\nMedia Highlights\nT&D World: New Technologies Mitigate Wildfire Risks for Utilities\nRead more\nPower Grid International: How utilities are keeping the sparks from flying\nRead more\nAustralian Financial Review: Simple gadget provide additional wildfire protection\nRead more\nT&D World: Three Strategies for Mitigating Wildfire Risk\nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

Housed in a NEMA 1 enclosure, the SCS is installed as a modular component in the control cabinet of the circuit breaker at the factory.\n\nAny model can be used for any synchronous closing or opening application by means of configuration and external wiring. A bypass circuit, providing ganged breaker operation in case of loss of DC power, can be enabled or disabled via an external jumper.\n\nThe current firmware version is 3.55, Build 14. \n \n\nFeatures\nSame firmware and hardware supports synchronous opening or synchronous closing of grounded/ungrounded capacitor bank energization.\nFirmware upgrades are possible in the field via serial port extending life of product via future upgrades\nNo EPROM changes are required\nThe SCS can be powered down without data loss\nBoth settings and event data are stored in non-volatile Flash memory\nBattery-free design\nA real-time clock is powered by a gold capacitor while DC power is off\nAutomatic tracking of the delay between arcing and auxiliary contact operations for synchronous opening (patent pending)\nDetection of wiring errors through phasor calculation (patent pending)\nWhy Hitachi Energy?\nControlled point-on-wave switching is a very effective way of reducing switching transients and enhancing circuit breaker performance\nSynchronized closing reduces transient over-voltages and currents associated with switching operations of shunt capacitor banks and shunt reactors\nSynchronized opening allows for optimization of the circuit breaker arcing time. The arcing time may be increased with the purpose of minimizing the probability of re-ignitions\nReduced interrupter wear\nGet to know more\nSoftware CB Insight™\n\nCB Insight™ is a user-friendly software program used to receive data from the SCS or to configure it. The program utilizes “wizards” to simplify tasks such as commissioning or data downloads. The wizards are of a “non-blocking” kind for which Hitachi Energy has a patent pending. “Non-blocking” means that the wizard window does not obstruct the main window and that many functions remain available to the user while the wizard is executing. CB Insight™ provides remote communication through dial-up or TCP/IP and can be used to view captured waveforms as well as statistical data pertaining to the synchronous performance (patent pending). \n \n\nRelated offering\nAir-insulated switchgear (AIS)\nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

The method is also gaining acceptance for re-energizing of EHV transmission lines, replacing traditional pre-insertion resistors. Since 1986, thousands of Switchsync® controllers have been delivered all over the world.\n\nSwitchsync® PWC600 is Hitachi Energy's latest generation of point-on-wave controllers, based on the well-proven Relion® platform of protection and control products. Offering the full functionality and reliability of previous Switchsync® products, it additionally includes Ethernet interfaces, which support modern communication protocols such as IEC 61850, electronic voltage and current transducers, and enhanced functionality for the user.\n\nSwitchsync® PWC600 is designed for single-pole operated circuit breakers, controlling each pole to close and/or open at the optimal point on the wave for the switched load, the circuit breaker, and power quality. It features unprecedented flexibility for switching various loads with diverse configurations, comprehensive monitoring functionality to track circuit breaker behavior and handling multiple loads connected to the same breaker. For power transformers, PWC600 can estimate the residual fluxes in the core to minimize energization transients under all switching scenarios. It compensates for variations in environmental factors and drifts in circuit breaker properties. An intuitive configuration tool including a library of Hitachi Energy circuit breakers and local and web-based user interfaces facilitate easy access to the relevant functions. The product offers waveforms and operations recording facility with time & date stamping to assist in interpreting controlled switching performance.\n\nHitachi Energy's high-voltage circuit breakers are well suited for controlled switching, featuring consistent operating times and steep and stable dynamic dielectric withstand capability.\n \n\nWhy Hitachi Energy?\nLocal and global support on all aspects of controlled switching technology\nMore than 35 years of domain experience and technical expertise, with thousands of Switchsync® controllers installed for various applications and environments\nComplete controlled switching solutions where circuit breaker and controller go together, helping to resolve complex switching issues\n \nSwitchsync® Controller\tMain Application\tControls Circuit Breaker Operations\tCircuit Breaker Operation\nState-of-the-art Switchsync® Controller with IEC 61850 compliance\nPWC600\tShunt capacitor banks, shunt reactors, power transformers, power cables\tOpen and close\tSingle-pole\nRelated offering\nAir-insulated switchgear (AIS)\nRead more\nDisconnecting Circuit Breaker (DCB) 72.5 – 550 kV\nRead more\nOpen rack shunt banks QBank\nRead more\nPower Transformers\nRead more\nShunt reactors\nRead more\nRelion product family\nRead more\nSomething caught your eye?\n\nOur sales team will get in touch with you\n\nContact us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

    "html": "Login\nGlobal | EN\nContact us\nSearch\nProducts & Solutions\nServices & Consulting\nMarkets\nSustainability\nAbout Us\nNews & Events\nCareers\nHome\nProducts & Solutions\nTransformers\nDistribution Transformers\nTransformers with Transient Voltage Protection (TVP) Technology\nTransformers with TVP® Technology\nWelcome to the Future of Transformers Reliability!\n\nAt Hitachi Energy, we have pioneered a groundbreaking solution designed to safeguard your transformers like never before – Transformers with Transient Voltage Protection (TVP®) Technology.\n\nAfter successfully installing 2500 units of dry-type transformers in diverse applications and geographical regions with TVP® technology over the past 7 years, with no known field failures, Hitachi Energy has expanded the TVP® technology to liquid-filled transformers too.\n\nElevate your distribution transformers to new heights of reliability and resilience.\n\nWatch the film to learn more.\n\nWhy is protection from transient voltage important?\n\nIf your processes require a lot of electrical network switching or if your electrical networks are causing a lot of nuisance tripping, then your transformers are at risk of premature failure due to switching transients - that would result in a costly outage. \n\nMedium voltage, fast-acting circuit breakers like Vacuum Circuit Breakers (VCBs) pose a unique and pressing concern across industries: transient voltage.\n\n\nWhile Vacuum Circuit Breakers (VCBs) have incredible arc-quenching capabilities that bring increased safety and efficiency to electrical systems, in certain system configurations and procedural operations, VCB (and SF6) switching can produce fast transient overvoltages inside of transformer windings, some leading to failures. These failures result in system downtime and irreparable equipment, both incredibly costly to network managers.\n\n\nFor an in-depth understanding of the threat from transient voltage, please visit the blog post on The Hidden Threat:  Transient Voltage. \n\n\nThe only perfect solution: Hitachi Energy’s Transformers with TVP® technology\n\n \n\nTransformers with Transient Voltage Protection (TVP®) Technology by Hitachi Energy provide complete protection for your electrical systems at every single switching instance. Their network-agnostic design makes them the best fit for you, no matter what your network configuration is or how often switching operations are performed.\n\nOur transformers equipped with TVP® have varistors strategically integrated into the transformer windings to enhance the coil technology. Their location protects coils from both reignitions and resonance amplification during switching events, thereby completely eliminating the risk of any damage from sudden transient peaks and subsequent costs of downtime and repair/replacement.\n\nFigure 1: Worst-case switching scenario of a 20kV Dry type transformer\n\nThe waveforms in Figures 1 and 2 below represent actual laboratory testing, representing worst-case switching scenarios for 20kV Dry type and liquid-filled transformers. It is evident from these charts that TVP® limits transient voltage peaks to a controlled, predictable level that is safe for the transformer.\n\n\nFigure 2: Worst-case switching scenario of a 20kV liquid filled transformer\n\nWhat makes TVP® stand out from other available solutions?\nOptimal solution\nAs TVP® works in all system configurations, no complex and time-consuming system is required\nCompetitive solution over RC snubber\nDoes not alter the transformer footprint\nTVP® solution comes inbuilt with Hitachi Energy Transformers and does not require any additional maintenance- no site installation hassle for customers/end users.\nFull protection\nTVP® is the only solution that limits transient voltages to a controlled, predictable, safe level.\nIt protects transformers and downstream equipment from both reignitions and resonance over-voltages.\n \nProven field record\n~2,500 units of TVP® equipped Hitachi Energy Dry-type transformers operating in the field for over 5 years.\nNo field failure was reported.\nProven for a diverse range of applications such as Datacenter, Industries, Rail Infrastructure, mainstream, etc.\n \nWhy Choose Hitachi Energy's Transformers with TVP® Technology?\nProven Reliability\nFor the past decade, Hitachi Energy has been at the forefront of innovation, producing Dry-type Transformers with TVP® technology. ~2500 units are operating globally, demonstrating unparalleled reliability with zero failures.\nExtended expertise\nWith over a century of experience in transformer technology, Hitachi Energy stands as a global leader.

Increasing amounts of transmitted energy push the networks to the limit, increasing the risk of network instability.\n\nPSTs allow controlling the power flow in the transmission grid independently of the generation. Avoiding system overloads and instabilities protects transmission lines and HV equipment from thermal overload, improves transmission system stability, and controls the power flow between different networks for parallel long-distance overhead lines or for parallel cables.\n\nPSTs are highly specialized pieces of equipment that require leading-edge design and manufacturing skills combined with stringent quality control.

Forecaster arms utilities and energy companies with data-driven insights that help them make better operational and financial decisions for short- and long-term planning to help mitigate risk and seize opportunity.\n\nBased on advanced models, Forecaster can be easily configured to meet specific needs of any country or energy market. Predictions are derived using two methods: neural network technology for short-term forecasts and multiple linear regression techniques for longer time horizons.\n\nForecaster enables organizations to improve forecast accuracy by tracking forecasts with actual values and integrating new data as soon as it becomes available. The neural network algorithm becomes progressively smarter as it learns load and price variables triggered by weather events, time-of-day cycles, holidays and other historical data.  \n\n“A core part of Hitachi Energy’s score for innovation derives from its combination of operational analytics with analytics for finance and risk (bringing together load forecasting and trading, for example).

This means the wheels are driven by electric motors independent whether the electricity is provided by overhead lines, a 3rd rail, batteries or even an on-board diesel engine.\n\n\nThe motors in turn are controlled by so called traction converters that supply an AC current with variable frequency to adjust the motor speed. The heart of such a traction converter is the power semiconductor that switches the motor current on- and off to generate the desired voltage and current shape for the motor. Originally gate turn-off thyristors (GTO) have been used for traction converters but new built converters are now mostly based on IGBT modules. As a market leader for both GTO and IGBT modules for traction converters Hitachi Energy offers the latest generation of HiPak IGBT modules.\n\nWith the revolutionary LinPak IGBT module Hitachi Energy provides a flexible and in current scalable solution especially suited for light rail vehicles (LRV), metro trains and (diesel-) electrical multiple unit train coaches (EMU/DMU).\n\n\nExamples of traction applications benefitting from Hitachi Energy's IGBT modules and GTOs:\n- High speed trains\n- Electric and diesel-electric locomotives\n- Region trains (EMU / DMU)\n- Metro\n- Light rail vehicles / tramways\n- Coaches (auxiliary power for air conditioning and lighting)\n- Commercial, construction and agricultural hybrid vehicles (CAHVs)\n\nOur offerings for traction\nIGBT and diode modules\nGTOs\nLinks and downloads\nPower semiconductors catalog\nRead more\nProduct brochure\nRead more\nSEMIS simulation tool\nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

Since IGBTs feature multiple parallel chips, there is a challenge - with conventional press-packs - in assuring uniform pressure on all chips. This problem was solved with a new patented spring technology.\n\n\nThe StakPak, optimized for series connection, features a modular concept based on submodules fitted in a fiberglass reinforced frame, which allows a flexible realisation of a range of products for different current ratings and IGBT/diode ratios.\n\n\nFor downloading and printing of data sheets in PDF format, click on the part numbers. \n\n\nPart Number\tVCES (V)\tIC (A)\tVCESAT (V) typ.125 °C\tVF (V) typ.125 °C\tIGBT-to-diode ratio\tHousing\tPlecs model\tOffer\n5SNA 1300K450300\t4500\t1300\t3.4\t2.4\t1:1\tK\t XML\tRequest\n5SNA 2000K450300\t4500\t2000\t3.4\t2.4\t1:1\tK\t XML\tRequest\n5SNA 2000K451300\t4500\t2000\t3.65\t3.0\t2:1\tK\t XML\tRequest\n5SNA 2000K452300\t4500\t2000\t3.65\t3.0\t2:1\tK \t XML\tRequest\n5SNA 3000K452300\t4500\t3000\t3.65\t3.0\t2:1\tK\t XML\tRequest\n5SMA 3000L450300\t4500 \t3000\t3.1\t-\t1:0 \tL\tXML\tRequest\nSemiconductors' worldwide distributors\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

To facilitate the new demands placed on the power grid, power semiconductor technologies are used.\n\nHigh power semiconductors are key components to control the power generation and connection of the network from renewable energy sources such as wind turbines and photovoltaic cells. To achieve highest efficiency of the energy source it is essential to select the right device for the given conditions. The semiconductors are used for two main tasks in the chain of renewable energy sources, one is the conversion of power in the plant, such as in wind turbines, and second is the transmission of power to the grid. As example, on an offshore wind farm the produced energy is converted up to four times by means of power semiconductors before it enters the distribution network.\n\n\nMore benefits:\n- Increasing energy efficiency\n- Higher power capacity\n- No emissions in the generation process\n- Flexibility to produce energy where it is needed\n\nOur offerings for renewables\nIGBT modules\nRead more\nStakPak\nRead more\nFast recovery diodes\nRead more\nIGCTs\nRead more\nLinks and downloads\n Power semiconductors catalog \nRead more\n SEMIS simulation tool \nRead more\nRelated offerings\nHigh-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC)\nOffshore wind connections\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

They are pressed with a relatively high force onto heat-sinks which also serve as electrical contacts to the power terminals.\n\nThe IGCT's turn-on/off control unit is an integral element of the component. It only requires an external power supply and its control functions are conveniently accessed through optical fiber connections. The device's control power consumption typically ranges from 10 - 100 W.\n\n\nThe IGCT is optimized for low conduction losses. Its typical turn-on/off switching frequency is in the range of 500 hertz. However, in contrast to the GTO, the upper switching frequency is only limited by operating thermal losses and the system's ability to remove this heat. This feature, in conjunction with the device's fast transition between on and off state, enables short on-off pulse bursts with switching frequencies of up to 40 kHz.\n\n\nIGCTs require a turn-on protective network (in essence an inductor) to limit the rate of current rise.

The typical on-off switching frequency is in the range of 200 - 500 hertz.\nChat with Live Agent\n\nProduction of GTOs commenced in the mid 1980s. A GTO is a thyristor that can be turned off by applying a current to the gate in the reverse direction to that required to turn it on.\n\nGTOs are optimized for low conduction losses. The typical on-off switching frequency is in the range of 200 - 500 hertz for most applications. GTOs are, by nature, relatively slow switches.\n\n\nTypical transition times from on to off state and vice versa are in a range of 10 - 30 microseconds. All GTOs require protective networks called \"snubbers\" for turn-on and turn-off. The turn-on snubber circuit, in essence an inductor, limits the rate of current rise. For turn-off, the GTO requires a device that limits the rate of voltage rise, in essence a capacitor.\n\n\nAll Hitachi Energy GTOs are press-pack devices.

They are pressed with a relatively high force onto heat-sinks which also serve as electrical contacts to the power terminals.\n\nThe IGCT's turn-on/off control unit is an integral element of the component. It only requires an external power supply and its control functions are conveniently accessed through optical fiber connections. The device's control power consumption typically ranges from 10 - 100 W.\n\n\nThe IGCT is optimized for low conduction losses. Its typical turn-on/off switching frequency is in the range of 500 hertz. However, in contrast to the GTO, the upper switching frequency is only limited by operating thermal losses and the system's ability to remove this heat. This feature, in conjunction with the device's fast transition between on and off state, enables short on-off pulse bursts with switching frequencies of up to 40 kHz.\n\n\nIGCTs require a turn-on protective network (in essence an inductor) to limit the rate of current rise.

But they are often located in densely populated areas or close to sensitive ecosystems. Using oil-filled transformers in such areas could pose a hazardous risk of fire and oil spills to humans and the environment. In such cases, dry-type transformers are a preferred alternative. Therefore, customers are specifying dry-type transformers more frequently to minimize environmental contamination and fire hazards.\n\nApart from being oil-free, all components of dry-type transformers are in solid form; they do not have flash points or require bushings. Thus, major causes of fire and oil spillage are eliminated. The majority of insulating components used dry-type transformers can also be easily recycled. Moreover, the total cost of ownership for dry-type transformers is much lower due to the lower cost of installation and the need for a fire suppression system.\n\n\nHitachi Energy has been leading the development, manufacturing, and supply of dry-type transformers for more than 40 years - with path-leading technological innovation. Hitachi Energy offers a full range of dry-type transformers with primary voltages through 72.5 kV built according to all major standards, including IEC and ANSI. \n\n\nWith recent technological advances, Hitachi Energy has successfully designed and installed a dry-type transformer that can withstand 100 kV / 550kV Basic Impulse Level (BIL). Thus paving the way for using this sustainable and environment-friendly transformer technology at even sub-transmission level.\n\n\nThese transformers meet strict parameters with respect to electrical system demands and functioning in areas with extreme climatic conditions. Hitachi Energy's dry and cast transformers are virtually maintenance-free and are manufactured in accordance with industry and international standards, including ISO 9001.\n\n \n\nWhy Hitachi Energy?\nMore than 40 years in the market\nPerfected and developed technologies to include all applications\nContinuous innovation, research, and development with a focus on customers\nMore than 40,000 dry-type transformers operate all around the globe\nOur Coil Technologies\nVacuum cast coil (VCC) transformers\nLearn more\nRESIBLOC® transformers\nLearn more\nOpen wound transformers\nLearn more\nOur Solutions\nCompactCool Technology\nLearn more\nTransformers with Transient Voltage Protection (TVP) Technology\nLearn more\nHiDry dry-type transformers (> 40.5 kV)\nLearn more\nLine voltage regulators\nLearn more\nNetwork transformers\nLearn more\nAutotransformers\nLearn more\nEarthing transformers\nLearn more\nLow voltage transformers (< 1.1 kV)\nLearn more\nRelated Offerings\nDistribution transformers\nLearn more\nTraction transformers\nRead more\nReactors and inductors\nLearn more\nTransformer service\nLearn more\nLearn more\nTransformers\nVisit the Transformers webpage\nRelated News and Events\nHitachi Energy launches innovative oil-free and plug-and-play traction transformer\n\nRESIBLOC® Rail dry-type traction transformer with integrated cooling system is designed to reduce CO2 emissions and total operating costs, while increasing energy efficiency\n\nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

The main attraction of going offshore is the enormous wind resource available. Average wind speeds can be 20 percent higher, and the resulting energy yield up to 70 percent greater than on land. The lack of obstacles such as hills, and the generally smooth surface of the sea, also makes the wind more reliable.\n\n\nWith more and larger wind parks set to be built offshore, major investments are needed to find ways to feed the power into the grid. The alternating current technology used in the first, smaller offshore wind parks is increasingly reaching its limits on account of the high reactive power demand of the cables. For wind farms distant to the coast, HVDC Light is the ideal means to bring the power to shore and to assure a good power quality.\n\nThe HVDC Light converter stations have a small station footprint and low weight - a fact that is of particular importance in the offshore station.\n\nThe on-shore (receiving) converter station can be located close to the shore or further inland. The grid is sometimes rather weak (radial structure) along the coastline, but this may not necessarily be a problem, since HVDC Light can be connected to weak points. But it is also easy to bring the connection point to a major substation at some distance from the shore by means of the HVDC Light cables.\n\nThe newest example of a HVDC Light wind farm transmission offshore is the 1200 MW Dogger Bank.\n\nReferences\nDogger Bank\n\nDogger Bank Wind Farm will be the world’s largest offshore wind farm when completed in 2026.\n\n\nRead more\nDolWin5\n\nHitachi Energy transmission technology supports Germany’s green energy transition.\n\n\nRead more\nDolWin2\n\nThe link will help avoid more than three million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.\n\nRead more\nDolWin1\n\nA new world record with VSC at ±320 kV\n\nRead more\nElectric grids: The ultimate supply chains\n\nYour exclusive copy of The Economist's Technology Quarterly\n\nDownload the full report\nOther HVDC applications\nBack to back\nAn HVDC Light® back-to-back station consists of two converters located in the same building.\nRead more\nCity center infeed\nHVDC applications: City center infeed\nRead more\nConnecting remote generation\nConnecting remote generation\nRead more\nConnecting remote loads\nHVDC application: Connecting remote loads\nRead more\nDC links in AC grids\nHVDC application: DC links in AC grids\nRead more\nExtensions Upgrades and Retrofits\nHVDC application: Upgrades, extensions and retrofits give new lease on life for an HVDC link\nRead more\nInterconnecting grids\nHVDC application: Interconnecting grids\nRead more\nOverhead transmission lines for HVDC\nHVDC overhead lines clearly have far smaller footprints than AC overhead lines and DC electrical losses are lower.\nRead more\nPower from shore\nHVDC application: Power from shore\nRead more\nLinks and downloads\nPart of category\nPress Release\n30-08-2022 | 3 MIN READ\n Hitachi Energy launches Grid-eXpand to accelerate grid expansion for a carbon-neutral future \nRead more\nPart of category\nPerspectives\n24-08-2022 | 13 MIN READ\n Offshore grids: The energy transition’s next frontier \nRead more\nPart of category\nPerspectives\n19-08-2022 | 9 MIN READ\n Proactive grid planning is key to unlocking Europe’s net-zero vision \nRead more\nPart of category\nPress Release\n28-06-2022 | 3 MIN READ\n Hitachi Energy and Petrofac to collaborate in growing offshore wind market \nRead more\n Conference papers on offshore wind connections \nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

Coupled electricity markets require stable, controlled power flows for electricity trading to work effectively, or at all and this is obtained using HVDC technology. \n\nElectrical networks in separate countries can evolve quite differently and may have very different standards and technologies. Direct Current (DC) is the only possible technical solution when interconnecting energy markets that operate at different frequencies (asynchronous) or are otherwise incompatible, allowing them to exchange power without requiring the tight coordination of a synchronous network. \n\nFurthermore, HVDC interconnections help to reduce system losses, increase transmission capacity, improve power quality and help to integrate more renewable power into the energy mix.\n\nReferences\nCaithness Moray HVDC Link\nRead more\nMaritime Link\nRead more\nNordLink\nRead more\nHigashi-Shimizu\nRead more\nOther HVDC applications\nBack to back\nAn HVDC Light® back-to-back station consists of two converters located in the same building.\nRead more\nCity center infeed\nHVDC applications: City center infeed\nRead more\nConnecting remote generation\nConnecting remote generation\nRead more\nConnecting remote loads\nHVDC application: Connecting remote loads\nRead more\nDC links in AC grids\nHVDC application: DC links in AC grids\nRead more\nExtensions Upgrades and Retrofits\nHVDC application: Upgrades, extensions and retrofits give new lease on life for an HVDC link\nRead more\nOffshore wind connections\nHVDC application: Offshore wind connections\nRead more\nOverhead transmission lines for HVDC\nHVDC overhead lines clearly have far smaller footprints than AC overhead lines and DC electrical losses are lower.\nRead more\nPower from shore\nHVDC application: Power from shore\nRead more\nRelated articles\nPart of category\nPerspectives\n24-08-2022 | 13 MIN READ\nOffshore grids: The energy transition’s next frontier\nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

In most cases, this is due to very high power transmissions and long distances, approximately 600 km or more, usually from remote power generating stations.\n\nHVDC is well suited for such applications, since the cost is lower than it would be for similar AC transmissions. A DC line needs only two main conductors, while an AC line needs three, and DC electrical losses are lower. HVDC converter stations do cost more than the AC terminal stations, so a certain distance is required in order for an HVDC system to make economic sense.\n\n\nLong distance HVDC applications using overhead lines are found around the world, in the USA, Canada, Brazil, China and India.\n\nThe figure below compares the Three Gorges-Shanghai power transmission as an AC and a DC transmission system. The top line shows two 3,000 MW HVDC lines, compared to the five 500 kV AC lines (below) that would have been needed if AC transmission had been selected to deliver the same amount of power.

Furthermore, the coupling of electricity markets and growing commercial interconnections (merchant links) require precise, controllable power flows in order to operate effectively.\n\nIn power transmission investments, features such as stability enhancement, emergency power support, power quality improvement, bottleneck mitigation and controllability of power flows are usually not given much attention in the investment assessment, unless they are deemed absolutely essential from a purely technical point of view.\n\nAn increasing number of DC transmissions embedded in the AC grid will result in a more controllable and precise power exchange. DC technology can provide more secure and optimized control of the network's load flow, as well as quick power restoration in the event of a significant disturbance, even a blackout. DC transmissions can compensate for fluctuations in power, voltage and frequency, making it an ideal technology for stabilizing a power system.

In such a network, the power can be exchanged over different routes, and the cost of power can be considered common to the all loads in the network. However, there are also many hard-to-reach places that are not connected to a power network.\n\nThese distant loads include islands and cities in remote areas, or industries in remote locations such as mines. The supply of power to a distant load can be made by a radial transmission from a meshed network or by local generation using diesel generators or gas turbines. Depending on the amount of electricity needed, the distance to the load and other geographical factors, AC or DC transmission can complement or even replace local generation as the power supply for a remote load. The decision to use AC or DC transmission will depend on the specific technical and economic conditions of individual projects.\n\nUsually the remote load must be of a certain magnitude, and the location not too close in order for the HVDC solution to be competitive. Remote inland loads are probably rather small. For example, supplying a 100 MW load with a 1,000 km overhead line is feasible for HVDC Light, provided it can compete with local generation.\n\nIn the case of sea crossings to islands and peninsulas, AC cables are only feasible for relatively short distances - about 80 km, depending on voltage and power level, due to the cable’s charging currents. This is a classical application for HVDC.\n\nOther HVDC applications\nBack to back\nAn HVDC Light® back-to-back station consists of two converters located in the same building.\nRead more\nCity center infeed\nHVDC applications: City center infeed\nRead more\nConnecting remote generation\nConnecting remote generation\nRead more\nDC links in AC grids\nHVDC application: DC links in AC grids\nRead more\nExtensions Upgrades and Retrofits\nHVDC application: Upgrades, extensions and retrofits give new lease on life for an HVDC link\nRead more\nInterconnecting grids\nHVDC application: Interconnecting grids\nRead more\nOffshore wind connections\nHVDC application: Offshore wind connections\nRead more\nOverhead transmission lines for HVDC\nHVDC overhead lines clearly have far smaller footprints than AC overhead lines and DC electrical losses are lower.\nRead more\nPower from shore\nHVDC application: Power from shore\nRead more\nLinks and downloads\n Papers: Interconnection of Greek islands with dispersed generation via HVDC Light technology \nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

Today energy is mostly generated by burning fossil fuels, but in addition to the serious impact this has on the environment, these resources are finite. As they become harder to find and harvest, sustainable emissions-free renewable energy generation will undoubtedly come to play an important role in the energy business.\n\n\nWide-scale integration of renewable resources is so far the only sustainable, long-term solution to problems of finite energy supplies and soaring energy demand, which at current growth rates is expected to double every 30 to 40 years.\n\nThere are challenges to large scale integration of renewable generation into the energy mix. To be viable, projects have to be installed where they can be fully and efficiently utilized, and such locations are typically far away from load centres that need the energy the most. Hence, integrating renewable generation on a large scale will also require a considerable increase in power transmission capacity and efficiency. \n\nHVDC transmissions already deliver electricity generated by hydro, wind, and solar plants to millions of consumers every day. The best generating sites are usually in remote areas, so the electricity generated from mountaintops, deserts and seas often crosses vast distances to get to where it is needed most. HVDC is the most reliable and efficient way of getting it there. Low loss DC transmission technology ensures virtually all renewable generation reaches consumers.\n\nFor example, a 2,000-km long DC transmission line at 800 kV loses about 5 percent of its power, while the power losses in an AC line of similar voltage are about twice as high. HVDC is the only option for the underground transmission of power over distances of more than about 50 km.\n\nOther HVDC applications\nBack to back\nAn HVDC Light® back-to-back station consists of two converters located in the same building.\nRead more\nCity center infeed\nHVDC applications: City center infeed\nRead more\nConnecting remote loads\nHVDC application: Connecting remote loads\nRead more\nDC links in AC grids\nHVDC application: DC links in AC grids\nRead more\nExtensions Upgrades and Retrofits\nHVDC application: Upgrades, extensions and retrofits give new lease on life for an HVDC link\nRead more\nInterconnecting grids\nHVDC application: Interconnecting grids\nRead more\nOffshore wind connections\nHVDC application: Offshore wind connections\nRead more\nOverhead transmission lines for HVDC\nHVDC overhead lines clearly have far smaller footprints than AC overhead lines and DC electrical losses are lower.\nRead more\nPower from shore\nHVDC application: Power from shore\nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

Land space being scarce and expensive, substantial difficulties arise whenever new right-of-way must be secured to carry additional power over traditional transmission lines.\n\n\nAs power transmission levels increase, the risk of exceeding the short-circuit capability of existing switchgear equipment as well as other network components becomes another real threat to the further expansion of power networks. Strategies to develop urban power networks must also address issues like power congestion, pollution, acoustical and electrical noise, power quality and control, and permits, among others.\n\nWith HVDC technology all the above issues are solved. The HVDC Light converter stations are compact and by virtue of their control, they do not contribute to the short-circuit levels. The controls can balance power flow on multiple urban infeeds. The DC cables are easily installed underground using existing right-of-ways and the capacity can thus be increased on existing power corridors.\n\nOther HVDC applications\nBack to back\nAn HVDC Light® back-to-back station consists of two converters located in the same building.\nRead more\nConnecting remote generation\nConnecting remote generation\nRead more\nConnecting remote loads\nHVDC application: Connecting remote loads\nRead more\nDC links in AC grids\nHVDC application: DC links in AC grids\nRead more\nExtensions Upgrades and Retrofits\nHVDC application: Upgrades, extensions and retrofits give new lease on life for an HVDC link\nRead more\nInterconnecting grids\nHVDC application: Interconnecting grids\nRead more\nOffshore wind connections\nHVDC application: Offshore wind connections\nRead more\nOverhead transmission lines for HVDC\nHVDC overhead lines clearly have far smaller footprints than AC overhead lines and DC electrical losses are lower.\nRead more\nPower from shore\nHVDC application: Power from shore\nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

There are several back-to-back stations in operation in the world. In these installations both the rectifier and the inverter are located in the same station and are normally used in order to create an asynchronous interconnection between two AC networks, which could have the same or different frequencies. Another benefit is using a back-to-back for splitting up a too strong network to reduce short circuit current. \n\nThe direct voltage level can be selected without consideration of the optimum values for an overhead line and a cable and is therefore normally quite low, 150 kilovolts (kV) or lower.

The result is a significant increase in the transient and voltage stability in transmission systems.\n\nSeries Compensation with Thyristor Control (TCSC) enables rapid dynamic modulation of the inserted reactance. At interconnection points between transmission grids, this modulation will provide strong damping torque on inter-area electromechanical oscillations. As a consequence, a TCSC rated at around 100 Mvar makes it possible to interconnect grids having generating capacity in the many thousands of megawatts. Often the TCSC is combined with fixed series compensation to increase transient stability in the most cost effective way.\n\nThe TCSC concept also enables inherent immunity against subsynchronous resonance (SSR), and thus allows for extended use of series capacitors in specific transmission grids comprising thermal generation. The immunity to SSR is a result of the Hitachi Energy patented SVR control strategy.\n\n\nThyristor controlled series compensation principle\nThere are two main principles supporting TCSC technology.\n\nFirst, the TCSC provides electromechanical damping between large electrical systems by modulating the reactance of one or more specific interconnecting power lines. In other words, the TCSC will provide a variable capacitive reactance.\n\nSecond, the TCSC will change its apparent impedance (as seen by the line current) for subsynchronous frequencies in such a way that a potential subsynchronous resonance is avoided.\n\nThe TCSC achieves both objectives by using control algorithms that work concurrently. The controls will function on the thyristor circuit (this in parallel to the main capacitor bank) such that controlled charges are added to the main capacitor, making it a variable capacitor at fundamental frequency but a \"virtual inductor\" at subsynchronous frequencies.\n\nThyristor controlled series compensation technology\nFrom a principal technology point of view, the TCSC resembles the conventional series capacitor. The power equipment is located on an isolated steel platform, including the thyristor valve used to control the inductor in parallel with the capacitor bank. The inductor is placed on support insulators outside the platform. Control and protection systems are located on ground potential, together with other auxiliary systems.\n\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

An SVC will typically regulate and control the voltage to the required set point under normal steady state and contingency conditions and thereby provide dynamic, fast response reactive power following system contingencies (e.g. network short circuits, line and generator disconnections). In addition, an SVC can also increase transfer capability, reduce losses, mitigate active power oscillations and prevent over voltages at loss of load.\n\nThe Static Var Compensators (SVCs) is customized to fit each customer with their specific needs. The SVC consists of a number of fixed or switched branches, of which at least one branch includes thyristors, and the combination of branches can be varied a lot depending on requirements. An SVC typically includes a combination of at least two of the given items below (e.g. TCR/FC or TCR/TSC/FC):\n\nThyristor controlled reactor (TCR)\nThyristor switched capacitor (TSC)\nHarmonic filter (FC)\n\nMost common topologies for Static Var Compensators are: TCR/FC or TCR/TSC/FC. The main advantage for using a topology with TSC branch(es) is to reduce the losses (by reducing the filter size).

Since the transmitted load often varies considerably from one hour to the next, the reactive power balance in a grid varies as well. This can result in unacceptable variations in voltage, including voltage depression or even voltage collapse.\n\nLike SVC but faster, STATCOM continuously provides variable reactive power in response to voltage variations, supporting the stability of the grid. STATCOM operates according to voltage source converter (VSC) principles, combining unique PWM (pulse width modulation) with millisecond switching. STATCOM functions with a very limited need for harmonic filters, contributing to a small physical footprint. If required, switched or fixed air core reactors and capacitors can be used with the VSC as additional reactive power elements to achieve any desired range. \n\n\nInstalling a STATCOM at one or more suitable points in a grid will increase power transfer capability by enhancing voltage stability and maintaining a smooth voltage profile under different network conditions. Its ability to perform active filtering is also very useful for improvements in power quality. \n\n\nHitachi Energy's offerings in the high power STATCOM field include SVC Light STATCOM as well as PCS 6000 STATCOM, where PCS 6000 STATCOM is applicable for unit ratings up to 40 Mvar and SVC Light STATCOM is applicable for ratings exceeding 40 Mvar.\n\nSVC Light® STATCOM\n\nSVC Light is a VSC concept, based on a chain-link modular multilevel converter (MMC), particularly adapted for power system applications. Physically, SVC Light can be considered a voltage source behind a reactance. It generates and absorbs reactive power by electronically processing voltage and current waveforms in the VSC, rendering unnecessary to include physical capacitor and reactor branches for generating/absorbing reactive power.  It is capable of yielding a high reactive power input to the grid more or less unimpeded by possible suppressed grid voltages, and with a high dynamic response.\n\n\nThis is particularly useful, for instance, to support weak grids and to improve the performance of large wind farms under varying grid conditions, as well as of grids loaded by a large percentage of air conditioners in hot and humid climates. SVC Light´s effective rating and speed of response is unequalled. For instance, for high speed rail systems and heavy industrial plants it is applied for voltage balancing of asymmetrical loads, mitigating voltage flicker created by electric arc furnaces, and active harmonic filtering.  \n\n\nIGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors) are key components in SVC Light. The multilevel chain-link solution is built up by linking H-bridge modules in series with one another to form the phase legs of the VSC. Fig. 1a shows a single H-bridge with four IGBTs, and Fig. 1b shows a configuration in which four H-bridge modules make up each of the three phase legs.\n\n \n\nSVC Light is available for system voltages up to 69 kV and converter ratings of up to -/+ 360 Mvar. For higher voltages, a step-down transformer is used to connect SVC Light to the grid. SVC Light provides a symmetrical operating range. For asymmetrical operations and in order to optimize performance, thyristor-switched reactors and capacitors are operated in parallel to form hybrid solutions.\n\nA photograph of modular H-bridge units, two stacks of four modules each, is displayed in Fig. 2. The compactness of the IGBT valves, the absence of physical capacitor and reactor branches for generating/absorbing reactive power, plus the minute need for harmonic filters enable a very compact lay-out of SVC Light.\n\nPCS 6000 STATCOM\n\nPCS 6000 STATCOM is an efficient power system package specifically designed to be connected to demanding networks. The flexibility of the system allows it to be applied to a wide range of applications such as dynamic voltage stabilization, voltage balancing of asymmetrical loads, mitigating voltage flicker created by electric arc furnaces, and active harmonic filtering.\n\nThe PCS 6000 STATCOM is particularly competitive in terms of installation time and space requirements. Furthermore, the high efficiency and low maintenance lead to low operational costs. The PCS 6000 provides outstanding performance for both steady state and dynamic operation as a pure static device with no switched passive elements.\n\n\nThe PCS 6000 STATCOM solution is virtually maintenance free, due to the minimized number of moving mechanical parts. Outages for inspection can therefore be scheduled according to the customer’s needs and preferences. No rotating parts in the energy path result in extremely high reliability, availability and low operational costs combined with long life expectancy. The equipment is typically installed in a pre-assembled container. The STATCOM system including controls, power electronics and cooling unit are tailor made for fulfilling the customer specific requirements.\n\nPCS 6000 converter\n\nThe PCS 6000 STATCOM uses advanced IGCT technology (Integrated Gate Commutated Thyristor) that has been developed by Hitachi Energy from a proven bipolar semiconductor background (GTO). The PCS 6000 converters are based upon IGCT PEBB (Power Electronic Building Block). This standardization allows systems to be realized with lower engineering and design costs and therefore affecting the customer’s end cost in a beneficial way. The innovative connection configuration allows for very good harmonic performance with typically no need for a harmonic filter.\n\nTime savings\n\nHitachi Energy has ensured that the design concept of the modular container system reduces on site construction time to a minimum. The converter equipment is pre-assembled and tested to the highest standards, and is shipped to site as a container package ready for immediate installation. Thanks to the high degree of standardization, the defined interfaces on site commissioning work can be reduced to a minimum. Due to the modular design the system can even be relocated to a new site within a short time.  \n\nOur offering\nSTATCOM - Hybrid\nCombining STATCOM and classic SVC technologies\nRead more\nSTATCOM - PCS6000\nContainerized STATCOM for multiple grid applications\nRead more\nSTATCOM - SVC Light®\nSTATCOM technologies for transmission, industrial and renewable applications\nRead more\nSTATCOM - SVC Light® Enhanced\nCombining STATCOM and energy storage for the new green energy landscape\nRead more\nSTATCOM for distributed power\nSTATCOM for distributed power supports any requirement from 3MVAr to 20MVAr\nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

The result is a significant increase in power transfer capacity and improvement of voltage and angular stability in transmission systems.\n\nFixed series compensation has long been the preferred solution for optimizing performance in very large bulk transmission corridors.\n\nIn a transmission system, the maximum active power transferable over a certain power line is inversely proportional to the series reactance of the line. Thus, by compensating the series reactance to a certain degree, using a series capacitor, an electrically shorter line is realized and higher active power transfer is achieved.\n\nInstalling a capacitive reactance in series in a long (typically more than 200 km) transmission line reduces both the angular deviation and the voltage drop, which increases the loadability and stability of the line. Since the current through the transmission line directly \"drives\" the MVAr output from the capacitor, the compensation concept is \"self-regulating”, and this straightforward principle ensures that series compensation is an extremely cost effective solution.\n\nSeries compensation also improves the voltage profile along the power corridor and optimizes power sharing between parallel circuits.\n\nSeries compensation technology\nBecause series capacitors are installed in series on a transmission line, the equipment must be  elevated on a platform at system voltage,  fully insulated from ground . The capacitor bank together with the overvoltage protection circuits are located on this steel platform. Overvoltage protection is a key design factor, as the capacitor bank must be able to withstand the throughput fault current, even at a severe nearby fault. The primary overvoltage protection typically involves metal-oxide varistors, a Fast Protective Device/ FPD (CapThor) and a fast bypass switch. The digital control and protection system, designed to  act very quickly  on signals from optical current transducers in the high-voltage circuit, is located on ground and communicates with the primary equipment on the platform and measurements via fiber optics.\n\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

As the power grid evolved, so too have the communication networks that support them. Through the most recent years, communication strategies have been largely independent of the operational strategy in a typical utility/industrial organization. Accordingly, companies across many industries have seen a proliferation of built-for-single-purpose communication networks, oftentimes with little to no interoperability between them. \n\nWith the continued convergence of IT and OT strategies within the last 5 years, the most advanced organizations are driving strategies to consolidate communication networks into a single multi-purpose network not only to meet today’s demands for high bandwidth, low latency, and high reliability but to also meet future expansion needs.  Those strategies include, though are not limited to, the following considerations:\n\nPrivate vs Public vs Hybrid networks\nWired vs Wireless\nCost-Benefit Optimization between Reliability, Bandwidth, and Latency\nCurrent Age of Infrastructure vs Modernization Horizon\nTotal Cost of Ownership, OPEX reduction, CAPEX optimization\n\nHitachi Energy has a full portfolio of wired and wireless communication products to meet the most demanding mission-critical communication needs in the market. Along with that product portfolio is a complete professional services portfolio to enable the most efficient and competent network deployment process, including:\n\n \n\nNetwork Planning\nInstallation Services\nTurnkey Project Management\nNetwork Health Check \nSolutions\n\nHitachi Energy has a full portfolio of wired and wireless communication products to meet the most demanding mission-critical communication needs in the market. Along with that product portfolio is a complete professional services portfolio to enable the most efficient and competent network deployment process, including:\n\nNetwork Planning Installation Services Turnkey Project Management Network Health Check\n\nNetwork planning actually begins during the proposal phase of the project and is best executed with real-time asset location data in a customer’s desired coverage territory.  A desktop design based on those assets and other customer specifications for network performance is done with tools like EDX Signal Pro, AlphiMAX, Google Earth Pro or other similar visualization tools, and the result is a KMZ file complete with locations of customer assets proposed gateway and node locations, and a resultant bill of material. This bill of material becomes the basis of the turnkey proposal.\n\nUpon commencement of the actual project, the desktop design is reviewed, evaluated against any new requirements, and used to drive the site survey portion of the project. Site survey crews are deployed to review and audit every proposed location from the desktop design.  Crews are trained to look for any conditions that could hinder the optimum performance of the deployed equipment, including but not limited to\n\nThe actual existence of the asset (mounting pole, distribution automation asset)\nInterferences not evident from visualization tools (trees, shrubs, buildings, etc)\nHeight or other visual limitation of proposed mounting asset\nCellular signal (where applicable for hybrid network deployments)\n\nFeedback from these surveys is incorporated into the preliminary network design for the creation of the final network design and bill of material. This final information is presented and reviewed with the customer in a formal design review and approval.  Any changes required from this review are incorporated and final designs are then used to generate the database of installation locations for the project. \n\nLearn more\nCommunication Networks\nRead more\nWireless Networks\nRead more\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

This ensures the defense-in-depth approach and is supported all in the FOX615 platform.\nPower line carrier: Hitachi Energy draws on over 75 years of experience of data transmission on power lines. Hitachi Energy's power line carrier communications portfolio offers extensive functionality. It is easy to configure and to upgrade – thereby ensuring that the customer remains at the forefront of technology for years to come.\nIEC 61850 GOOSE: Recent development of IEC 61850 standard as well as activities in the Teleprotection industry lead towards generic packet-based protection schemes. For line distance protection the IEC 61850 standard allows the use of GOOSE messages. FOX615 with the integrated TEGO1 interface provides an IEC 61850 Gateway functionality where the TEGO1 interface card acts as an IED, connects to up to 8 different remote ends and provides selective filtering of GOOSE messages, translation capabilities in case of miss-matching configurations and controlled access to the station bus from remote ends through the WAN.\nNetwork management: All Hitachi Energy Communication Network solutions are fully integrated into FOXMAN-UN , including FOX615 and it’s utility-specific interfaces for distance and differential protection. FOXMAN-UN provides sophisticated supervision features, such as a graphical representation of the communication network, a view of the synchronization status of FOX615 network elements, and performance monitoring of links. In addition, FOXMAN-UN allows certain tasks, such as firmware distribution and activation, to be automated and scheduled.\nSCADA: Today’s utilities depend on automatic systems to monitor, control, and protect their network and the investment it represents. Modern automation isn’t just about collecting, and collating, data; though that remains a central task of any automation system, the increasing intelligence of IED’s, Relays, and RTUs offers scope for greater autonomy too. Mission-critical communications enable decisions to be made locally, or in concert with other local devices, while centralized SCADA systems alert human operators to decisions made by the machines.\nRelated offering\nFOX Multiservice Platform\nNSD570\nWireless Networks\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

One of the most important advantages with modern HVDC technology is the controllability.\n\nThe Modular Advanced Control for HVDC (MACH™) control system provides unequalled calculation capacity and enables a high degree of integration and handling for all control and protection functions. Moreover,\n\n\nModular Advanced Control for HVDC (MACH™) control provides advanced fault registration and remote control functions. The system is designed to run 24/7 for thirty years or more, allowing the HVDC system to be controlled and protected in the most reliable way throughout its life time.\n\nTo fulfill current and future requirements Hitachi Energy has developed the Modular Advanced Control for HVDC (MACH™) system as a fully computerized one, using state-of-the-art computers, microcontrollers and digital signal processors connected by high-performance industrial standard buses and fiber optic communication links. Because of the extensive use of computers and micro-controllers, it has been possible to include very powerful internal supervision, which eliminates periodic maintenance of the control equipment.\n\nThe system consists of the station control and monitoring servers, operator workstations, control and protection main computers, digital signal processor units, I/O systems and valve control units. Thanks to the modularity and high performance of the MACH equipment, the type of hardware and system software used for a VSC-HVDC  control system are the same as in an LCC-HVDC or a FACTS control system. In fact, only the application software and the valve control differs.\n\nThe ability to upgrade is yet another advantage with Modular Advanced Control for HVDC (MACH™). That means even an older HVDC system can enjoy the benefits of great controllability. This is a great way to prolong the lifetime of an existing transmission link with rapid project completion and minimal transmission disruption.\n\nRelated News and Events\nPart of category\nPress Release\n20-09-2022 | 4 MIN READ\nHitachi Energy to support major renewable electricity transmission between Canada and New York City\nRead more\nPart of category\nPress Release\n03-08-2022 | 3 MIN READ\nHitachi Energy supports huge step in Germany’s energy transition\nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your enquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

Online monitoring is an effective tool to increase performance, reduce failure risks, and cut maintenance costs. Compared to traditional diagnostic methods performed on-site with the transformer de-energized, monitoring gives you, the asset owner, access to real-time condition information, even from remote locations. When changes in conditions are detected, you are notified immediately.\n\nThrough remote access, the status of the equipment can be evaluated without dispatching an engineer to the site, saving both valuable time and resources. Since monitoring detects condition changes in real-time - versus periodically with traditional diagnostic methods - you have time to plan and act before faults occur.\n\nWith the help of our TXpert™ Services, you, as an asset owner, can decide the level of digitalization for your transformer, which will help you determine the right course of action by having complete visibility and control over the performance of your asset or fleet.\n\nThese services can also be designed as packaged solutions or long-term agreements.\n\nRelated Offerings\nTXpert™ Hub\nRead more\nTXpert™ Ready Sensors\nRead more\nAsset Performance Management Software\nRead more\nTXplore™ transformer inspection robot\nRead more\nEngineering and consulting\nRead more\nInspection and diagnostics\nRead more\nTransformer service\nRead more\nDC Mitigator\nRead more\nContact us\n\nSubmit your inquiry and we will contact you\n\nContact Us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

Lack of reliable or up-to-date information can lead to delays in responding to important events, potentially causing unplanned outages or catastrophic failures.\n\nCollecting real-time data from assets such as transformers, switchgear, battery energy storage solutions and EV chargers equips your organization with the ability to make effective and informed decisions about those assets. Up-to-date information provides visibility into the condition of assets and enables more advanced applications like asset performance management.\n\nWith Hitachi Energy's software and digitally-enabled services portfolio, insights into asset performance over time ensures optimal operation and return of investments made.\n\nThe Energy Connect platform consists of two major components: Edge and Core.\nEnergy Connect Edge\n\nThe Edge is a carrier for IoT service in a form of a dedicated hardware device or a software package. It is deployed on Hitachi Energy equipment on-site, directly connected to assets monitored with sensors. Edge is managed securely from Energy Connect Core side over the Internet, using Wi-Fi or built-in cellular connectivity.\n\nUsing an open and extendible software architecture, the Energy Connect Edge interfaces with sensors or monitoring devices using industrial protocols, such as IEC 61850 or Modbus TCP.\n\nCollected telemetry measurements are enriched with local data context, converted into a common data model and securely transmitted to the Energy Connect Core.\n\nEnergy Connect Core\n\nThe Energy Connect Core is a virtual solution for data acquisition, analysis and storage, deployed on Hitachi Energy cloud infrastructure. It serves as an aggregation point for all datapoints collected from digitally enabled assets via edge devices, secure long term repository and facilitates secure data access for Hitachi Energy digitalization solutions.\n\nDesigned with data security and confidentiality as a priority, Energy Connect Core ensures data ownership and custody from a collection at source to destination in cloud repository.\n\nCollected information is being used by Hitachi Energy digitally-enabled services portfolio to generate insights and create value for our Customers.\n\nIf you'd like to understand more about how our Energy Connect Industrial IoT Platform could help your operations, please contact us.\n\nSpeak to us\nContact Us\nJobs\nSupplying\nCybersecurity Alerts\nWho We Are\nCountry and Regional Information\nEvents & Webinars\nEnergy Portal (Hitachi)\n\nFollow us\n\n \n \n \n \n\nHitachi Group Website\n\n© Hitachi Energy Ltd. 2024.

Today’s electric energy automation and operational technology (OT) control systems interconnect with multiple networks, systems, and locations, which has increased operational efficiencies tremendously. However, these interconnected digital system also has introduced cybersecurity concerns previously known only to office or enterprise IT systems. Furthermore, global challenges - such as more published vulnerabilities, a growing number of cybersecurity incidents targeting industrial control systems, and the increase in digitalization - have made it more complex to secure the electric energy OT automation and control system infrastructure.\n\nWhen it comes to cybersecurity, the primary focus is on understanding cyberthreats and risk management. At Hitachi Energy, we are guided by the following principles: there is no such thing as 100 percent cybersecurity, and cybersecurity is not a fixed destination but an evolving target from new threats and bad actors.\n\nHitachi Energy’s end-to-end cybersecurity solutions assess risks wherever they arise, from control centers to communications networks to substation automation systems. We develop highly secure, trusted cybersecurity solutions for industrial and electric energy OT infrastructure, and mission-critical environments. Our evolving innovative product and system solutions place the highest priority on reliability and security.\n\nSECURITY AND SAFETY\nEnsure defense in depth cybersecurity best practices are followed to manage internal and external threats.\nSUPPORTING ASSET OWNER’S REGULATION COMPLIANCE\nProduct and solutions support a constantly changing regulatory environment.\nUPTIME\nMaximize availability of assets, infrastructure, communications, and power network.\nSUPPORT AND INCIDENT RESPONSE\nGet global access to our local experts 24/7 for security and incident response support.\nCOST SAVINGS\nReduce operations and maintenance costs from cybersecurity solution capabilities to monitor, manage and protect critical cyber assets and systems.\nSecure your cyber assets and systems\nCYBERSECURITY BY DESIGN\n\nCybersecurity is an integral part of product development at Hitachi Energy.
