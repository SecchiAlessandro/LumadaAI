According to a Gartner survey, most organizations are processing between 51 and 100 SRRs per month, with processing of a single access request costing more than $1,500.\n\nOur new global platform presents a visionary solution to your complex SRRs management needs. One which is proven to bring unrivalled efficiency gains. A typical cost of processing a single access request across our platform is approx. $235 or lower depending on the volumes — a staggering 84% below the average cost of $1,500.\n\nBusiness Needs\n\nReplace existing manual, labour intensive data privacy processes with a fully automated scalable, flexible and configurable solution with key requirements such as,\n\n• Records & Risk Management\n• Risk Screening\n• DPIA\n• Subject Rights Requests Management\n• Data Mapping\n• Knowledge Store\n• Ticketing\n\nMitigate regulatory and reputational risk with an end-to-end audit trail providing evidence for all access, amendment and deletion of data.\n\nUtilize existing data privacy workflows to aid seamless integration and adoption.\n\nAccelerate SRR fulfillment whilst lowering costs and ensuring reliability.\n\nA modular solution to support existing and emerging regional or global privacy laws and regulations.\n\nValue Proposition\n\nIt’s simple, intuitive, and cost-efficient\n\nManage PII for all existing and new customers as well as employees is managed, controlled, and audited\nacross a single platform.\nInformation is presented in a user-friendly way that’s easy to navigate, access and manage – driving\ncost-efficiency.\nA platform that supports existing and emerging Global Privacy and Regulation laws.\n\nIt’s scalable, flexible, and configurable\n\nThe platform provides flexible workflow configuration that supports existing as well as new\nworkflows and can be adapted to specific needs, including meeting any global data rights management\npolicies.\nKey requirements such as records and risk management, risk screening, ticketing, knowledge\nstore, DPIA, SRR management and data mapping, are supported as standard.\n\nIt’s automated, auditable, and secure\n\nThe platform enables the automated editing, censoring, and obscuring of any personal or PII-based\ninformation that is not required to be kept as part of ongoing regulatory and business-related\nrecords.\nAudit trails provide evidence for all access, amendment, and deletion of data.\nSecured by adherence to BSI 10008 and ISO 27001 standards.\n\nSelf-service enabled\n\nData subjects can be provided with direct secure access to the platform empowering them to control their\nown information.\nThis improved experience will lead to higher customer trust and satisfaction along with improved\noperational efficiency.\nPlatform Module Features\n\nData mapping\n\nRisk screening\n\nData protection Self-Assessment\n\nRights request management\n\nROPA / A30 records\n\nData protection Impact Assessment\n\nRisk management\n\nTicketing\n\nKnowledge stores\n\nBenefits\n\nIf Data Rights Management feels awkward and time-consuming, you’ve got an ally in us. After encountering one too many pain points when it came to the management of Data Rights, GlobalLogic developed the solution we wish was on the market. Using our digital engineering experience to build a sophisticated end-to-end solution, we cut through the complexity and reduced our own Data Rights response times by 85%. We now want to share the solution with you.\n\nOur solution is not just a workflow tool or a redaction tool, it’s a streamlined, automated, multi-lingual platform. It provides a global secure, scalable, and self-service solution that is fully auditable, and future proofs Data Controllers’ needs and requirements.\n\nBy investing in a single platform to deliver a sustainable, proactive customer and Data Privacy Office experience, you remove the need for multiple data rights management suppliers and technologies. Not only will this save you time, money, and a calendar reminder to renew several annual licenses, you’ll gain a partner who’s walked the walk, understands your pain points and designed a solution that solves them.\n\nLet’s Work Together\nResource center\nBlogs\nA Digital Product Engineering Guide for Businesses\n\nWhat is digital product engineering and how can it help transform your business?
