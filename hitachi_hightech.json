The development of AI-related technologies has enabled us to predict the molecular structure of materials and manufacturing methods through the analysis of past experiments and papers. The core of AI is a technology based on statistical mathematics called machine learning, and we will fully use information processing technology, including machine learning, in developing materials.\n\n\"Materials Informatics\" is made up of technologies from various fields such as theory of properties, experiments, simulations, databases, cloud computing, security, etc., in addition to this machine learning. Materials informatics, also called as the fusion field of materials science and information science, has accelerated its application due to the technological development in both fields. Driven by the high performance of supercomputers and the large scale of materials science databases, the environment has enabled the high-speed handling of huge amounts of data, which has encouraged the use of materials informatics.\n\nOn the other hand, governments of various countries are actively investing in materials informatics, and during the Obama administration in the U.S., approximately 200 million dollars were spent to promote materials informatics. Following this movement, the promotion of materials informatics spread to Europe and China; in Japan, the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) and other organizations have begun efforts to promote materials informatics since 2015. This is a field that will continue to attract a lot of attention.\n\nComparison of conventional and \"materials informatics\"\nin materials search.\n\nSo far, materials search has been widely conducted by a single researcher who selects and designs compounds based on his knowledge and experience, and performs many syntheses and evaluates their properties. Materials informatics, which uses material databases and AI to calculate material properties with high precision on computers, is expected to support researchers' knowledge and intuition with data, saving them a great deal of time and cost.\n\nDOWNLOAD\n\nYou can download the product documentation for Chemicals Informatics.\n\nDownload Here\nContact Us\n\nPlease feel free to contact us with any concerns or questions prior to introducing the system.\n\nInquiry\nBack to Top\n\nHitachi High-Tech\n\nHitachi High-Tech Global Top\n\nProducts & Services\nSearch by Product\nSearch by Industry\nSearch by Social Issues\nKnowledge\nSupport\nNews & Events\nAbout Us\nGroup Companies\nSustainability\nCareers\nHitachi Group Global Site\nProducts & SolutionsCorporate InformationGlobal NetworkContact Information\nHitachi GLOBAL Website\nTerms of Use Privacy Policy\n© Hitachi High-Tech Corporation. 2001, 2024.

Comparing the DSC results, the electrolyte including cathodematerials generates heat at the lower temperature side than electrolyte alone. This is because the oxygen is released by thermal decomposition of cathode and the electrolyte is oxidatively decomposed.

This application data sheet explains the results of SSRM/SEM-EDX imaging of the same portion of an ion-milling cross-section of two types of LIB cathodes under different pressing conditions.\n\nUnpressed sample\nFluorine (F) penetrates into the interface between the cathode layer containing the active material (Lithium Cobalt Oxide: LCO) and the Al collector, as can be seen from the EDX image. This is derived from the PVdF only contained in the binder. The areas indicated in red in the SSRM image with the highest resistance are considered to be resin impregnated for structural reinforcement and are presumed to have many voids.\nPressed sample\nThe penetration of PVdF into the electrode/collector interface area is much less in the EDS image, and the SSRM image also shows that this interface area has good adhesion. From these facts, it is considered that the pressed product has less voids and better contact of the active material.\n\nIn this sample, the AC impedance method also indicates that the internal resistance of the pressed sample is lower, 1) and it can be considered that it also responds to the results of the local SSRM/SEM-EDX observation and analysis.\n1) H.

(ENGLISH)\nCanada (ENGLISH)\nIndia (ENGLISH)\nIndonesia (ENGLISH)\nMalaysia (ENGLISH)\nSingapore (ENGLISH)\nThailand (ENGLISH)\n韓国 (韓国語)\nLanguage\n\nIn July 2019, an amendment to the RoHS directive will add 4 phthalates to the list of restricted substances. These 4 chemicals are widely used for insulated coating materials, electrical insulation tapes and packing films.\nThe HM1000A is a dedicated instrument designed for fast, easy, on-site screening of phthalates. In addition to easy operation, the HM1000A features high-throughput testing that achieves automated analysis of 50 samples in approximately 8 hours.\n\nContact Us\nFeatures\nEnhanced Functions\nSpecifications\nVideo\nFeatures\nHigh-speed measurement:Measurement at a rate of less than 10 minutes!\n\nVaporized compounds are ionized and directly analyzed by a mass spectrometer enabling high-speed measurement.(Separation column is not required)\n\nThe auto sampler allows for continuous automated analysis of 50 samples in 8 hours\n\nThe accurate and smooth performance of the auto sampler (standard equipment) allows continuous automatic analysis of up to 50 samples. During the analysis, operators are free to engage in other tasks, resulting in a streamlined operation and reducing workloads.\n\nEasy operation from sample preparation to analysis!\n\nPlace the sample in the sample pan and position it on the sample tray. Next, by following simple software steps, measurements will be started by the auto sampler. The auto sampler diagram is displayed on the software and the progress of measurements and the results (PASS/FAIL judgment) can be verified easily.\n\nLow operating costs\n\nNitrogen gas is used as the carrier gas. Using nitrogen gas generator (option available in Japan or locally sourced), a power source is the only utility required for operation. Helium gas and liquid nitrogen are not needed, which helps keep operating costs low.\n\nData\nMeasurement using scan mode\n\nThe m/z value obtained from analyzing the sample can be used to estimate the component that is contained in the sample.\n\nMass spectrum of sample containing 1000 mg/kg of Phthalates\n\nA peak will appear at molecular weight +1 for each phthalate after protonation.\n\n*\nMeasurement of total Phthalates is required for DBP and DIBP (both are at m/z=279)\n\nMeasurement using SIM mode\n\nThe concentration of the Phthalates contained in the sample can be estimated using the ion intensity profile and can be compared to the regulations acceptable limit.\n\nIon intensity profiles of DBP, BBP, DEHP\nThe measuring sample :Certified Reference Material NMIJ CRM 8152-a\n\n*\nEach protonated-Phthalate will be monitored using its m/z value.\n\nEnhanced Functions\nCalibration functions using data from measurements of alternative plasticizers as reference\n\nDi (2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DOTP) is included in alternative plasticizers used as replacements for the Restricted Substances. DOTP has a similar structure to the Restricted Substances. The HM1000A is calibrated for these substances that have similar structures based on ion intensity correlations. This has improved the identification accuracy of HM1000A, resulting in accurate measurements.\n\nSimultaneous SIM and SCAN measurements\n\nThe HM1000A achieves simultaneous SIM and SCAN measurements, thereby enabling measurements that reflect the periodicity in the mass spectrum. This improves the screening accuracy of samples that contain lubricants and other polymers.\n\nSpecifications\nConfigurations\tStandard equipment\tHM1000A (Main unit / Accessories)\nGeneral Specifications\tMeasuring object\tPhthalate (DBP/DIBP, BBP, DEHP)\nBrominated flame retardants (DBDE)\nSample weight\t0.2 mg ± 0.04 mg\nSample form\tSolid, Powder\nAuto sampler\tMax.50 samples\nMass detection\tIon source\tAPCI (Atomospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization)\nMass spectrometer\tQuadruple mass filter\nMeasurement mode\tScan mode\nSIM (Selected Ion Monitoring) mode\n(Max. 20 channels)\nDimensions and weight\tMain body\t510 mm (W) ×615 mm (D) ×615 mm (H), 85 kg\nRotary pump\t160 mm(W)×490 mm(D)×265 mm(H), 29 kg\nElectric specifications\tInput supply voltage\tAC200 V to 240V±10% single phase\nVideo\nHM1000A: the Fast and Easy screening device for Phthalates\n\nDemonstrating operation of measurement with HM1000A.

These processes allow the grating to provide a highly efficient diffraction efficiency in the designed wavelength region.\nGrating grooves having 2 or more different blaze anoles can be combined on a single diffraction grating. This structure allows for broader wavelength coverage.\nA variety of diffraction gratings with variable spaced grooves and shapes are manufactured.\nConcave Diffraction Grating\nFrom X-rays to Infrared! Gratings can now be designed to meet specific requirements.\nComa-type aberration-corrected concave grating for high resolution Seya-amioka monochromator:\nThis grating eliminates the coma-type aberration of the Seya-Namioka monochromator, which has been most widely used in monochromators with concave gratings that provide high resolution. Hitachi is manufacturing a wide variety of aberration-corrected gratings for Seya-Namioka monochromator which cover a wavelength range from the vacuum ultra-violet to the near infrared region.\nDiffraction gratings for compact, high efficiency monochromator:\nThese gratings are designed for normal incidence mounting.　They reduce aberrations and at the same time increase the efficiency of light intensity.\nA as a result, a high quality of image focusing of the concave grating is available.\nDiffraction gratings for flat field spectrograph:\nVariable space grooves enable flat-field image focusing of concave grating spectrograph. The spectrograph permits simultaneous measurement of multi-wavelength spectra when combined with a linear array detector. Gratings are designed optimally for the grazing-incidence optical system (for soft X-ray) and the normal incidence optical system (for VIS-UV ray), respectively.\nDiffraction gratings for multi wavelength optical communication:\nA compact and efficient aberration corrected concave grating is manufactured for transmitting multiple wavelength light beams through an optical fiber and acts to separate the beams at the receiving terminal.\nDiffraction gratings for soft X-rays:\nHighly dispersive concave gratings for grazing-incidence mounting are available especially used for synchrotron radiation and extreme ultra-violet applications.

The reflection image was orange and the fluorescence image was green. The separated images correspond to the reflection spectrum and fluorescence spectrum, respectively, and by summing the orange reflection image and the green fluorescence image, the sample appears yellowish. It was found that the in-plane optical characteristics (optical pattern) in the reflection image and the fluorescence image were different.

Fluorescence intensity is affected by changes in lamp brightness, room temperature, optical system, etc. The fluorescence intensity of the standard sample is measured, and the sample fluorescence intensity is converted to the fluorescence intensity relative to the standard sample. This standardization is also used for the intensity comparison between different instruments, including the analysis of humic substances in environmental water (conversion to quinine sulfate), the analysis of chlorophyll in water (conversion to fluorescein), and the specified value for reagent purity (conversion to quinine sulfate).\n\nSpecifications\nItem\tDescription\nSensitivity\n(Raman light of water)\tNoise: Background\tS/N 20,000 or above*3\nNoise: Peak\t1,200 or above*4\nMinimum sample volume\t0.6 mL (in use of standard 10 mm rectangular cell)\nPhotometric principle\tMonochromatic light monitoring ratio calculation\nLight source\t150 W xenon lamp, self-deozonating lamp house\nMonochromator\tStigmatic concave diffraction grating: 900 lines/mm, F2.2\nBrazed wavelength: Excitation side 300 nm, emission side 400 nm\nMeasuring wavelength range\n(on both EX and EM)\t200 to 750 nm, and zero-order light\n(Expandable up to 900 nm with optional detector)\nBandpass\tExcitation side: 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 nm\nEmission side: 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 nm\nResolution\t1.0 nm (at 546.1 nm)\nWavelength accuracy\t±1 nm\nWavelength scan speed\t30, 60, 240, 1,200, 2,400, 12,000, 30,000, 60,000 nm/min\nWavelength drive speed\t60,000 nm/min\n3D measurement time\t3 min*5\nResponse\tResponse from 0 to 98 %:\n0.002, 0.004, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 2, 4 s\nPhotometric value range\t-9999 to 9999\nData processing unit\tPC : Windows 7\nPrinter\tPrinter compatible with Windows 7\nDimensions/weight\tSpectrophotometer: 620 W × 520 D × 300 H mm(excluding protrusions), 41 kg\nWorking temperature\t15 to 35 °C, 25 to 80% (condensation not/humidity allowed, 70% or less at 30 °C, or higher)\nPower consumption\t100, 115, 220, 230, 240 V AC, 50/60 Hz, 380 VA\n\n*3\nEX 350nm, Slit 10 nm, Response 4 s\n\n*4\nEX 350nm, Slit 5 nm, Response 2 s\n\n*5\nEX 200 to 750 nm, Sampling interval 10 nm, EM 200 to 750 nm, Sampling interval 10 nm\n\nFunctions\n3-dimensional measurement\nWavelength scan\n3-dimensional scan measurement\nTime scan measurement mode\nPhotometry mode\nOthers\nOptions\nFluorescence Analysis of a Plate Sample from a Plasma Panel Display\nRemoving secondary light\nMicroplate accessory\nSystem for measurement under constant temperature\nFluorescence Analysis of a Plate Sample from a Plasma Panel Display\n\nAn example of measuring fluorescence spectra of a plasma panel display using a solid sample holder.\n\nAccessories\nSolid sample holder 650-0161\nExample of setting up sample\n3-D Fluorescence Spectra\n\nThe figure shows results of a 3-D measurement on a plasma display panel. On each excitation wavelength, blue, green, and red spectra are observed. The F-7000 series featuring a high scanning speed can obtain the data shown on the right in as little as 1.5 minutes.\n3-D assay presents a great deal of information from a single sample preparation process, thus reducing the amount of time required to run measurements. The ultra-high speed scanning of the F-7000 series can be a powerful tool for the measurement of samples that change with time.\n\nExcitation and Fluorescence Spectra\n\nResults of a 3-D measurement can also be represented in 2-D data. The graphs below show excitation and emission spectra of a plasma display.\nIt presents spectra at specific wavelengths. By using the blue, green, red spectra data represented in 2-D, the technique can be applied to the measurement of fluorescent colors (fluorescence chromaticity coordinates).\n\nWindow for fluorescence intensity standardization\nWindow for fluorescence intensity standardization\nRemoving secondary light\n\nIn surface light measurements, multi-order light, including second-order light, that is produced by light scattering interferes with the measurement. An effective tool for removing multi-order light is a cut filter. Fluorescence is based on the principles of Stokes, which can be observed at longer wavelengths than the excitation light.\n\nAccessories\nFilter set 5J0-0151\nEffects of a cut filter\n\nThe graphs below show the effects of using a cut filter based on sodium salicylic acid (powder) data. The filter (WG320) cuts the scattered light that would otherwise enter the detector and suppresses the occurrence of second-order light.\n\nThe following graphs also show data that are extracted from third-order data. It is clear that the occurrence of second-order light that is duplicate to the spectra is also suppressed on the second-order data.\n\nMicroplate accessory\n\nThe microplate accessory permits the direct assaying using the F-7000 of a sample applied to a microplate.\nThe accessory lends itself to automation for assaying as a microplate reader or an auto-sampler based upon the use of microplates.\n\nMicro Plate Reader 5J0-0139*¹\nCompatible microplate\t96 well wells (400 µL, flat bottom)\nMeasuring speed\t96 wells/60 s (in kinetics measurement mode)\nThermostatic function\tThermostatic water bath connectable 5 to 60 °C\n(Thermostatic water bath separately available)\n\n*1\nCompatible microplates are commercially available ones having 96 wells.\nBackground fluorescence level may be high depending on a selected microplate.\n\nFeatures of the microplate accessory\nEffective for the assaying of multi-specimen samples : compatible with 96-well microplates\nHigh-sensitivity assaying : Detection sensitivity : 5×10-11 mol/L (fluorescein)\nHigh-throughput assaying : 96 wells/60 seconds\nWide dynamic range : 6 digits or higher\nExample of PicoGreen® assay\n\nThe PicoGreen® can assay double-strand DNA, specifically and in high sensitivity, in a manner immune to the effects of RNA, single-strand DNA or proteins present in the sample. As such, the system is well-suited for the assaying of template amount in a DNA sequencer or PCR.\nThe use of the microplate accessory supports high-throughput measurement operations.\n\nSystem for measurement under constant temperature - Measurement of green fluorescent protein (GFP)\nThermostatted cell holder with stirrer 250-0346\nMicro cell 650-0116\nThree dimensional fluorescence spectra of GFP\n\nTypically, an increase in the temperature of a sample by 1°C causes a decrease in its fluorescence intensity by 1 to 2%. In addition, in the biological field, samples are measured in a similar condition to in vivo environment.\nHighly temperature-dependent samples and biological specimens should be measured under constant temperature using a thermostat cell holder.\nThe example shown here displays the fluorescence properties of green fluorescent protein (GFP). GFP is a fluorescent protein existing in Aequorea victoria, which is essential for measurements of intermolecular interactions (FRET, BRET), bioimaging studies, etc.\nWe measured the 3-D fluorescence spectra of GFP using the microcell with a stirrer. Since the sample solution is stirred with a magnetic stirring bar, measurements can be conducted with a greater accuracy in temperature.\n\n*\nWe have wealth of other optional accessories.\n\nDetection of Food Safety Using Fluorescence Fingerprint\n\nA report on detection of food safety using fluorescence fingerprint, extracted from Scientific Instrument NEWS, a technical magazine of electron microscope and analytical instruments.\n\nDetection of Food Safety Using Fluorescence Fingerprint \nCitations\nApplications \n\nIntroducing the measurement example using spectrofluorophotometer (FL).\n\nFluorescence Spectrophotometers (FL) Basic Course \n\nThe basics of fluorescence spectrophotometers (FL).\n\nRelated Products\nFluorescence Spectrophotometer F-7000\nFluorescence Spectrophotometer F-2700\nRelated Links\nApplication Note \nTechnical Support \nScience Ring \nBrochure\nBrochure\nContact Us\nContact Us\nPrevious Page\nBack to Top\n\nHitachi High-Tech\n\nHitachi High-Tech Global Top\n\nProducts & Services\nSearch by Product\nSearch by Industry\nSearch by Social Issues\nKnowledge\nSupport\nNews & Events\nAbout Us\nGroup Companies\nSustainability\nCareers\nHitachi Group Global Site\nProducts & SolutionsCorporate InformationGlobal NetworkContact Information\nHitachi GLOBAL Website\nTerms of Use Privacy Policy\n© Hitachi High-Tech Corporation. 2001, 2024.

(ENGLISH)\nCanada (ENGLISH)\nIndia (ENGLISH)\nIndonesia (ENGLISH)\nMalaysia (ENGLISH)\nSingapore (ENGLISH)\nThailand (ENGLISH)\n韓国 (韓国語)\nLanguage\n\nModel U-4100, the expert in solid-phase spectrophotometry, has advanced even more.\n\nNow, Model UH4150 has emerged inheriting the reliability of the U-4100 Spectrophotometer, which boasts the total number of shipments more than 1,500*1 units.\n\nContact Us\nFeatures\nSystem Lineup\nExample of application\nFeatures\nSmall signal level differences at detector switching afford highly accurate measurements even when the wavelength of detector is being switched.\n\nMultiple detectors are installed in the integrating sphere to perform measurement over a wide range of wavelengths, from ultraviolet to visible to near infrared regions. The changes in photometric values at detector switching (from signal level differences) are minimized due to a design utilizing Hitachi’s expertise in integrating sphere construction, signal processing technologies, etc.\n\nExample of Measured Data around the Wavelength of Detector Switching (Absorption spectrum of Gold Nanorods)\nLow stray light and low polarization characteristics are attained with Hitachi’s high-performance prism-grating double monochromator system.\n\nThe UH4150 adopts a prism-grating (P-G) double monochromator optical system, continuing the established reputation of the U-4100 optical system. Large changes in light intensity of the S and P polarization are less likely for the prism-grating (P-G) system than for the generally used grating-grating (G-G) system. The UH4150 offers low noise measurements, even for low transmittance and reflectance samples.\n\nCollimated light beam allows accurate measurement of reflected light and scattered light.\n\nThe incident angle is important for the measurement of specular reflectance of solid samples. For focused light beam, the incident angle varies depending on the lens’s focal length, etc. Consequently, the values of simulation of design of optical thin films, such as dielectric multilayer film and prism, would differ from actual measured values. In the case of a collimated light beam, however, the incident angle is always the same with respect to the sample, leading to a highly accurate measurement of specular reflectance. Moreover, the collimated light beam is useful for the evaluation of diffusivity (haze) and the measurement of transmittance of lenses.\n\nSpecular Reflectance measurement example\nA wide variety of detectors affords the selection of detectors suitable for measurement objectives.\n\nEight types of integrating spheres of different materials, sizes, and shapes are available.*2*3\n\nLineup of Detectors\nNew ergonomic design has been adopted.\n\nThe door of sample compartment is modified to improve the operation. An ergonomic design is adopted by taking into account the operation of replacing samples and accessories.\n\nCompatible with many of the U-4100 accessories.\n\nCommon accessories are available for both models. Accessories used with Model U-4100 can also be used with Model UH4150*4. Since the accessories are removable, they help to accommodate a wider range of measurement types.\n\nHigher throughput than Model U-4100.\n\nWhile maintaining the high-performing optical system of the model U-4100, the UH4150 provides higher throughput measurements. In the previous model, a scan speed of 600 mm/min was necessary for a measurement using a data interval of 1 nm. With Model UH4150, you can measure at 1 nm intervals while using a scan speed of 1,200 nm/min, reducing the measurement time significantly.*5 The UH4150 measures from 240 to 2,600 nm in approximately two minutes. It is effective for samples requiring measurement in UV-VIS-NIR wavelength range, such as Solar Reflective Materials.\n\nReflectance Spectrum of Solar Reflective Material using Scan Speed of 600 nm/min\nReflectance Spectrum of Solar Reflective material using Scan Speed of 1,200 nm/min\nAutomatic Measurement System\n\nWe have taken three popular peripheral systems for the UH4150 spectrophotometer—the automatic variable-angle absolute reflectance measurement system, the automatic polarization measurement systems, and 5 Degrees reflectance/transmittance measurement system with automatic X-Y stage—and converted them into standalone systems that can be purchased individually.\n\nDetails \nSystem Lineup\n\nIntegrating Sphere Detection System\n\nA variety of 60 mm integrating spheres are available. As optional items, we offer 150 mm integrating spheres or Continuously Variable Angle Absolute Reflectance accessories (60 mm standard integrating sphere is shown here).\n\nDirect Light Detection System\n\nThe direct light detector is built in the spectrophotometer. The direct light detector can be replaced with other optional detectors, such as various Integrating Spheres and Continuously Variable Angle Absolute Reflectance accessories.\n\nExample of application\nTransmittance Measurement of Micro Samples\n\nThe transmittance measurement accessory for micro samples supports the transmission measurement of samples such as micro glass pieces and pickup lenses.\n\nMeasurement Example of Pickup Lenses\nTransmittance Measurement System for Micro Samples (P/N 1J0-0204)\nSpecifications\nMask Type\tApplicable Sample Sizes\nΦ3 mm Mask (supplied standard)\tφ 5 - φ 20,\n3 mm or less thick\nφ 1 mm Mask (optional)\tφ 3 - φ 20,\n3 mm or less thick\n\n*\nIt is necessary to replace the light source mask with the supplied φ4-mm light source mask.\n\nDiffuse Reflectance Measurement\n\nDiffuse reflectance measurement of powder samples, etc. is possible by placing the sample behind the integrating sphere (sample side incident angle of 0°).\n\nExample of Diffuse Reflectance Measurement of Titanium (IV) Oxide\n60 mm Standard Integrating Sphere (for both total reflectance and diffuse reflectance) (P/N 1J1-0120)\nSpecifications\nIncident angle\t0°\nWavelength range\t240 - 2,600 nm\nOptical Thin-Film Industry\n\nThe Optical Thin-Film is an essential technology for optical components such as camera, lens of glasses, projector and mirror.\nThe accurate evaluation of optical characteristics is becoming more and more important for advanced development and quality control of optical components.\n\nMeasurement of Optical Characteristic of Plastic by UH4150 Spectrophotometer\n- An example of High Throughput measurements in the UV, Visible and Near-Infrared Regions - (PDF, 207KB)\nPlastic is a highly transparent, light, and durable material. For the optical evaluation of an object, such as light transmittance property, color, and transparency, the transmission spectrum and reflectance spectrum are measured by a spectrophotometer. These measurements do not only provide the optical information but also the information related to optical functions such as UV and infrared ray shieling levels. This time, the optical properties of various plastic materials were measured by using UH4150 spectrophotometer, the new model developed focusing on the photometric accuracy for solids such as optical materials. UH4150 is the spectrophotometer which inherited the optical system of U-4100 having an established reputation for its parallel beam and low polarization property that are suitable for the optical material evaluation. It is possible to change the detector and accessories depending on the analytical applications to meet various analytical requirements. Higher throughput, compared with the conventional instrument, was achieved and the analysis with the scan speed of 1,200nm/min for the sampling interval of 1 nm is possible. For example, for the wavelength range of the analysis introduced this time, the measurement can be completed in about 2 minutes.\n\nMeasurement Method of High Absorbance (Low Transmittance) Samples by UH4150 (PDF, 320KB)\nWith UH4150, a detector can be selected depending on the analysis purpose. When analyzing a solid sample which doesn’t contain any diffuse components, by selecting the direct light detector, the measurement of high absorbance can be performed with less noise, compared with the integrating sphere detector. One of the methods to measure high absorbance with a good accuracy is to use an attenuator. The standard installation of UH4150 includes the 1/100 attenuator. By using it in combination with the additional 1/100 attenuator in the sample chamber (on the reference side), the attenuation equivalent to that by a 1/10000 attenuator can be obtained and the measurement of very high absorbance (6 .7) becomes possible.\nThis time, using a light shielding apparatus as examples, the method for high absorbance analysis is introduced here.\n\nMeasurement Reproducibility of the Dielectric Multilayer by UH4150 Spectrophotometer - Comparison with the Lens Optical System of GG System - (PDF, 139KB)\nThe features of Model UH4150 include the installation of PG (prism-grating) monochromator and the application of collimated light beam. With the PG monochromator system, the change in the polarization characteristic is smooth and a stable baseline can be obtained. The collimated light beam compared with the focused light beam, the light beam rarely changes regardless of the sample resetting. As a result, a high measurement reproducibility can be obtained. This time, the transmission spectrum (incident angle of 0 degree, 5 times resetting) of a dielectric multilayer substrate was obtained. The reproducibility was compared with that of the generally used GG (grating-grating) system spectrophotometer in the same instrument class.\n\nDetermination of the Average Aspect ratio of Gold Nanorods (GNRs) using UH4150 UV-VIS-NIR Spectrophotometer (PDF, 163KB)\nAu nanorods are rod-shaped gold nano-particles. Since the shape of the rods (aspect ratio) controls the light absorption specificities, their application is currently under development to manufacture gold-particles to probe DNA or optical memory materials.\nNormally the aspect ratios of Au nanorods are determined by image-measurement using the transmission electron microscope (TEM). However, the aspect ratios of rods can easily be determined by measuring the peak location of the surface plasmon bands originating from the major-axis at around 900 nm.1) (Au nanorods have 2 surface plasmon bands along the major- and minor-axes originating from surface plasmon oscillation, as opposed to Au nano-particles that normally have only one surface plasmon band at around 520 nm. The absorption of Au nanorods is at around 520 nm for minor-axis and 900 nm for major-axis.) Peak location is derived from formula 1 based on the aspect ratio (R) of Au nanorods. Formula 2 will be obtained by solving formula 1 for the aspect ratio (R).\nIn this study, the aspect ratios were calculated from the absorption spectrum of Au nanorods using the UH4150 Spectrophotometer and in comparison with the values obtained from TEM images.\n1) S.

Therefore, an energy change in the light source can be compensated to ensure stable measurement for a long time.\n\nIncorporation of stigmatic concave diffraction grating\n\nThe optics of this instrument adopts the Seya-Namioka monochromator widespread as a representative concavediffraction grating monochromator.\nBecause a concave diffraction grating has both beam condensing and dispersing functions, an optical system canbe configured with fewer mirrors.\nIn a spectrophotometer, use of fewer mirrors signifies a shorter optical path,thus giving rise to an aberration-free bright optics.\nFor elimination of the aberrations which were essentially unavoidable in the past, a stigmatic concave diffractiongrating has been developed by applying Hitachi’s original technology. As a result, a higher resolution has been realized.\n\nA higher resolution has been achieved by eliminating coma from the Seya- Namioka monochromator which is the most popular concave diffraction grating monochromator. Its grooving is supported by the only ruling engine in Japan. The diffraction gratings of Model U-2900/2910 have also been made with this machine.\n\nSpectral bandpass 1.5 nm satisfying European Pharmacopoeia\n\nEuropean Pharmacopoeia requires a ratio of 1.5 or larger when measuring 0.02% (V/V) solutions of toluene in hexane.

Not only has the pulse been significantly reduced, but the Primaide 1110 Pump estimates pressure fluctuations and employs the optimal timing to set the plunger speed interval.\nImprovement of retention time reproducibility\nFor gradient analysis, injection by the Primaide 1210 Autosampler is synchronized with the movements of the pump. This ensures a highly reproducible retention time, and precise analysis.\nGradient Performance Evaluation/RT and Area Reproducibility\nPeak No.\tComponent\tRetention Time\nAverage / min.\tR.S.D. / %\n1\tAcetanilide\t2.032\t0.076\n2\tAcetophenone\t2.793\t0.080\n3\tPropiophenone\t3.581\t0.096\n4\tButyrophenone\t4.495\t0.102\n5\tBenzophenone\t4.809\t0.098\n6\tValerophenone\t5.639\t0.083\n7\tHexanophenone\t6.975\t0.082\n8\tHeptanophenone\t8.413\t0.068\n9\tOctanophenone\t9.882\t0.078\nCondition\nColumn\tHITACHI LaChrom C18 (5 µm) 4.6 mm I.D.×150 mm L.\nMobile phase\tA : CH3OH B : H2O\nGradient program\t0 - 11 min A 65 → 100%\nColumn Temperature\t40°C\nFlow rate\t1.0 mL/min\nDetection\tUV 265 nm\nInjection vol.\t10 µL (100 g/mL each.)\n1210 Autosampler\n\nThe Primaide 1210 Autosampler incorporates direct injection, allowing the automation of consecutive analyses without wasting precious sample.\n\nDirect injection of small-quantity samples and quicker analysis\nIn the direct injection method, the sampling needle becomes part of the flow channel so that the sample in the needle flows into the channel with zero waste. This is a great advantage in the analysis of valuable small-quantity samples. In addition, since the injection method is simpler than using a sampling loop, the injection cycle is shortened by half. This method accelerates throughput and improves efficiency in the analysis of many samples.\nImproved reproducibility results in high-precision analysis\nThe syringe for sample measurement is driven by a high-performance motor. The drive improves the reproducibility of injection. Furthermore, peak retention times are also more repeatable due to synchronization of injection with the pump motion, achieving higher analytical reliability.\n\nInjection Volume Reproducibility\n\nCondition\nSample\tMethyl paraben\nMobile phase\tCH3OH : H2O = 60 : 40\nFlow rate\t1.0 mL/min\nDetection\tUV 265 nm\n1310 Column Oven\n\nThe Primaide 1310 Column Oven also functions as a cooler. The preheating function obtains better performance from columns, achieving sharper peak shapes.\n\nMore resolved peaks with optimized heating\nPre-heating with an efficient block heater improves the symmetry and sharpness of peaks, eliminating the influence of ambient temperature changes. The column installation space, which features an air circulation system, permits the easy mounting and detaching of columns.\nCooling function is included as standard\nThe oven can regulate the temperature from 5°C to 65°C.\n1410 UV Detector\n\nThe optics of the Primaide 1410 UV detector allows data collection with lower noise and drift. The lamp and flow cell are situated in a front-access layout and are easily replaceable.\n\nLow noise for high-sensitivity detection\nThe Primaide 1410 UV detector achieves a noise level of no more than 0.6 × 10 -5 AU, greatly enhancing trace component analysis.\nHigh response and low noise for rapid analysis\nLow-noise measurements in 0.05 seconds.\nHigh-sensitivity detection rapidly yielding sharp and accurate peaks.\nStable, without influence from ambient temperature changes\nSince local environments may vary considerably, the optics of the UV detector is well designed to avoid the effects of daily and seasonal temperature changes, ensuring stable and reproducible results.\nWavelength measurement in the UV region with a built-in Hg lamp\nUse the 254-nm emission line of the mounted Hg lamp to test the accuracy of wavelength measurement in the UV region, which is the most utilized region in liquid chromatography. This test is conducted using 3 wavelengths from the Hg and D2 lamps, enabling highly reliable analyses across a broad wavelength range.\n1430 Diode Array Detector\n\nThe Primaide 1430 Diode Array Detector is as sensitive as a UV detector. The DAD system has many functions, including spectrum collection, chromatography using multiple wavelengths, a peak purity test, a spectral library, and more.\n\nHigh sensitivity\nNovel optics and improved software reduce noise considerably (0.5 × 10-5 AU or less). The reputation, \"DADs are less sensitive,\" is now obsolete.\nMinimizing the influence of temperature changes in the measurement cell\nThe light source is stabilized via a large lamp housing. The spectrometer and housing are separated and thermally insulated. By cooling the lamp housing separately, the influence of ambient temperature is minimized. The new design incorporates temperature sensors as well as an associated variable rotation speed cooling fan, which largely eliminate temperature changes inside the instrument. This reduces noise and enhances stability, allowing for stable analysis day after day.\nHigh resolution and accurate spectra\nHigh wavelength resolution (0.78 nm/data point) is achieved with an array of 1,024 photo diodes. Uniform resolution is maintained throughout a wide range of wavelengths from the UV to VIS, thanks to the diffraction optics, which features a grating.\nDigital noise reduction in rapid analysis\nData with a low level of noise are obtained in a very short sampling period (0.05 seconds). Noise-free, sharp peaks are obtained during rapid analysis.\nAutomatic wavelength calibration\nA built-in Hg lamp is utilized in the automatic wavelength accuracy test for the commonly-used UV region.\n\nThree-Dimentional Chromatogram\n\nOrganizer\nOrganizer capable of accommodating various solvent bottles\n\nThe organizer can accept the simultaneous mounting of the following solvent bottles.\n\nExample:\n1\t3.785 L (U.S. gallon bottle) × 2 + 500 mL × 2\n2\t1.0 L × 5\nOrganizer also is a power supply module\n\nThe organizer, which is also a power supply module, provides power to one pump, one autosampler, one detector (one UV detector, or one Diode array detector), and one interface control board.\n\nExample of Applications\n\nHere are some latest applications measured by the Primaide.\n\nAnalysis of Catechins (PDF, 272KB) \n\nCatechins are important antioxidant components found in tea. Due to their antioxidant properties and wide range of efficacy, research of catechins has been receiving an increasing amount of attention. The catechin profile in tea has been found to differ depending on the method of tea preparation. In addition, the catechins in tea form thermal isomers during the sterilization process of commercially available bottled tea drinks. The concentration of thermal isomers reaches significant levels, and, as such, the physiological function of these isomers is also of interest. The following describes examples of analysis of catechins and caffeine in tea.\n\nAnalysis of Organic Acids using UV Detection (PDF, 273KB) \n\nOrganic acids are known as ingredients that determine the taste and flavor of foods. In addition to the food sector, many other areas such as pharmaceutical and chemical industries, environmental analysis, and biotechnology, analyze organic acids.\nAnalysis methods of organic acids include UV detection (detection of absorption of carboxyl groups), electrical conductivity detection (detection of ionic compounds), a method using pH indicators (visible absorption detection of pH changes caused by acidic components) and a post-column derivatization method for high selectivity of detection. An appropriate method must be selected based on analysis samples and purposes.\nThe following describes examples of analysis of organic acids using a portable UV detection system and the reversed-phase column, \"LaChrom C18-AQ\".\n\nSimultaneous Analysis of Phenoxyethanol and Parabens (PDF, 297KB) \n\nParaben is a generic term for p-hydroxybenzoate esters. Due to their low toxicity in the human body, as well as antiseptic and mold proofing effects, parabens are used as preservatives in medicines, cosmetics, and foods. Phenoxyethanol is another component used as a germicide and antiseptic in cosmetics. It is a naturally-occurring compound that is found in substances such as green tea.\nPhenoxyethanol is often used in combination with parabens in cosmetics to reduce the added paraben content.\nIn this presentation, we will introduce and examine the simultaneous analysis of phenoxyethanol and parabens.\n\nAnalysis of Glycosides in Medicines (PDF, 313KB) \n\nGlycoside is a collective term used for the compound formed by glycosidic bonding between a sugar and a compound other than sugar (non-sugar component: aglycone).\nGlycosides are mainly O-glycosides, sugar derivatives with various physiological activities that are widely distributed in plants.\nGlycosides are also widely known as components of crude drugs. Presented here is the analysis of the glycosides swertiamarin, puerarin, paeoniflorin, sennoside, and glycyrrhizinic acid using HPLC with diode array detector (DAD).\nMultiple peaks of various components are detected in the analysis of a crude drug. By using DAD, the UV absorption spectra of the target component and the Standard Sample can be compared and confirmed and therefore, more accurate quantitative analysis is possible.\n\nSimultaneous Analysis of Water-Soluble Vitamins (PDF, 332KB) \n\nVitamins are essential nutrients, and are classified into water-soluble vitamins and fat soluble vitamins. We have simultaneously analyzed 9 water-soluble vitamin components by separation through a reverse phase column and diode array detector (DAD). By using DAD, detected peaks can be identified from absorption spectra. Thus, food and other samples containing many contaminants can be analyzed effectively.\nPlease take care to note that since vitamin C and erythorbic acid are unstable, they are easily decomposed during sample preparation or with the passage of time, and that it is difficult to obtain linearity and reproducibility. Therefore, these analysis conditions are suitable for qualitative analysis. For quantitative analysis, the use of an individual test method for each vitamin is recommended.\n\nAnalysis of Artificial Sweeteners (PDF, 223KB) \n\nAspartame is an artificial sweetener that is 100 to 200 times sweeter than sucrose. It is a dipeptide formed by peptide bonding of methyl ester of phenylalanine with aspartic acid. Aspartame is mainly added to low calorie and non-caloric drinks and foods. It is also sometimes used with other sweeteners such as sugar and sorbitol.\nExamples of analyses for aspartame in (1) carbonated drink and (2) apple cider vinegar drink are introduced here.\n\nSimultaneous Analysis of Dyes by HPLC-DAD (PDF, 238KB) \n\nFood dyes, when added to food or drinks, play an important role of enhancing palatability. Food dyes are largely divided into natural dyes and synthetic dyes. An analysis example for six synthetic dyes is introduced here.\nSix dyes analyzed here have maximum UV absorption at different wavelengths and therefore, DAD (diode array detector) was used to analyze them simultaneously. By using DAD, a chromatogram can be extracted at the optimal wavelength for each dye.\nAs a spectrum of a standard sample can be compared with that of a target component for confirmation, more accurate quantitative analysis is possible.\n\nNOTE:\nThese data are an example of measurement; the individual values cannot be guaranteed.\nThe system is for research use only, and is not intended for any animal or human therapeutic or diagnostic use.\n\nApplications \n\nIntroducing the measurement example using liquid chromatograph (HPLC) in various different fields.\n\nHPLC Basic Course \n\nThe basics of HPLC, from \"Principles and system configuration\" to \"Feature of various detection methods.\"\n\nScience Ring \n\nThe trademark that represents our strong bond with the customer and shows our pledge to connect science and society to create new value.\n\nRelated Products\nUltra-High Performance Liquid Chromatograph ChromasterUltra Rs\nHigh-Performance Liquid Chromatograph Chromaster\nHigh-Performance Liquid Chromatograph Chromaster® 5610 MS Detector\nRelated Links\nApplication Note \nTechnical Support \nScience Ring \nContact Us\nContact Us\nPrevious Page\nBack to Top\n\nHitachi High-Tech\n\nHitachi High-Tech Global Top\n\nProducts & Services\nSearch by Product\nSearch by Industry\nSearch by Social Issues\nKnowledge\nSupport\nNews & Events\nAbout Us\nGroup Companies\nSustainability\nCareers\nHitachi Group Global Site\nProducts & SolutionsCorporate InformationGlobal NetworkContact Information\nHitachi GLOBAL Website\nTerms of Use Privacy Policy\n© Hitachi High-Tech Corporation. 2001, 2024.

Furthermore, the guidance features include content for different purposes, such as LC and MS basic lectures, maintenance videos, and troubleshooting.\nThese can be conveniently viewed during the measurement.\n\nDisplay of the analysis log can be used to assess system stability\n\nTo obtain accurate analytical results, it is important to fully ensure device and system performance, including the column. Degradation of the column and variations in detection sensitivity can be easily determined by recording a summary of the theoretical number of plates, the resolution, and the reproducibility (SD, RSD). In addition, by setting RT window for results, assessment comments (Pass/Fail) can be noted, and the stability of the system can be assessed on a daily basis.\n\nSystem performance check\n\nData acquired for each analysis can be checked for quality. System Suitability Test (SST) reports conforming to the Japanese, US, and European Pharmacopeias (JP, USP, and EP) and operation check results that classify the operating conditions for each HPLC module can be summarized in a report.\n\nSystem suitability test report\n\nThis is useful for evaluating the overall analysis system. In addition, degradation of the column and other components can be evaluated by checking the theoretical number of plates each day.\n\nDaily maintenance support\n\nTo ensure that each HPLC module is in good condition, it is important to monitor and manage consumable parts. Part replacement dates, usage history (liquid feed amount, number of uses, cumulative time, etc.), and guidelines for recommended replacement can be recorded and checked to monitor the condition of consumables. This information can be output as a report or stored in a log. In addition, when it is time to replace a consumable, the Assist feature provides visual support through maintenance videos.\n\nTroubleshooting support\n\nWe have published a collection of specific troubleshooting examples in a guide and we provide support to resolve problems such as abnormal analytical results. These examples reflect the experiences of both Hitachi and Hitachi users collected over many years.\n\nSupporting modules\n\nChromAssist supports Chromaster, ChomasterUltra Rs, LaChrom Elite and LaChrom Ultra series modules which are described below.\n\nChromaster modules\nChomasterUltra Rs modules\nLaChrom Elite modules:\n\nL-2100 Pump, L-2130 Pump, L-2200 Autosampler, L-2300 Column Oven, L-2350 Column Oven, L-2400 UV Detector, L-2420 UV-VIS Detector, L-2455 Diode Array Detector, L-2480 FL Detector, L-2485 FL Detector, L-2490 RI Detector, AID and Organizer.\n\nLaChrom Ultra modules:\n\nL-2160U Pump, L-2200U Autosampler, L-2300 Column Oven, L-2350 Column Oven, L-2420 UV-VIS Detector, L-2455U Diode Array Detector and L-2485U FL Detector.\n\n*\nNote:\nChromAssist can control a maximum of up to 2 systems in the same (or different) series at the same time.\nHowever, please avoid using combining modules of each series in one system.\n\nSpecifications\n\nPlease refer to the following specification.\n\nChromAssist Data Station\nModule control\tSystem series name\tChromaster, ChromasterUltra Rs, LaChrom Elite, LaChrom Ultra *1\nNumber of systems\tMaximum of 2 systems (however, up to 1 MS Detector)\nNumber of data acquisition channels\t10 – 3,200 ms\n(L-2400/2420/2455/2480/2485, 5450, AID: 50 – 3200 ms\nL-2490: 100 – 3200 ms)\nAnalog input\tAID (1 ch/board, 2 boards/system, maximum of 2 ch) (however, data collection cycle 50 ms minimum)\nSupported PC\tOS\tWindows computer *2\nSoftware\tDAD control / analysis (standard specification)\nSystem suitability test (standard specification)\nData analysis features\tIntegration processing\tPeak determination depending on noise and peak sensitivity\nConfigurable integration method such as vertical partitioning, tailing, and integration inhibit\nQuantitative calculations\tCalculation methods: No Calibration(percentage method), Normalized Percent, External Standard,\nInternal Standard,Standard Addition, Manual\nCalibration curve order: linear R, linear C, Quadratic and Cubic,\nCalibration curve weight; 1.0, Conc, 1/Conc, 1/Conc*Conc.

Cooling Temperature Control, Air Protection Holder Unit, and Various options enable preparation of various cross section specimens.\n\nContact Us\nFeatures\nOptions\nTechnical Explanation\nSpecification\nOptional Specification\nCitations\nFeatures\nHigh Milling Rate\n\nThe cross section milling rate*1 of the IM4000II is 500 µm/h or greater. It is effective for hard materials that conventionally require extended processing.\n\n*1\nThe maximum milling depth in one hour for Si protruding 100 μm from the maskedge.\n\nSpecimen : Si wafer (2 mm thick)\nAccelerating voltage : 6.0 kV (IM4000II)\nSwing angle : ±30°\nMilling time : 1 hour\n\nWhen the swing angle during cross section milling changes, the corresponding processing width and depth change. The figure below shows the SEM images of a Si wafer after cross section milling. Processing conditions are the same as shown above except the swing angle has been reduced from ±30˚ to ±15˚. It is demonstrated that the processing depth is deeper than the above results and therefore very effective for rapid cross section preparation of specimens with a target structure far from the top surface.\n\nSpecimen : Si wafer (2 mm thick)\nAccelerating voltage : 6.0 kV (IM4000II), 8.0 kV (ArBlade 5000)\nSwing angle : ±15°\nMilling time : 1 hour\n\nHybrid Milling\nCross section Milling\n\nA pristine surface can be achieved by sputtering (milling) protruding parts of the specimen that extend beyond the maskedge. By irradiating the ion-beam parallel to the processed surface of the specimen, flat and smooth milling is possible even with complex materials of different compositions.\n\nMain Uses\nPrepare a cross section specimen in a localized region of interest (ROI)\nPrepare a cross section specimen that is difficult to polish by other methods (composite materials, multi-layer interface, papers/films, etc.)\nFlat-milling\n\nIn flat-milling, a wider area can be processed than in cross section milling via eccentricity of the ion-beam and rotating specimen center points. It is also possible to emphasize or reduce irregularities by changing the irradiation angle of the ion-beam in order to reveal crystal orientation and/or subtle compositional differences.\n\nMain Uses\nRemove mechanical artifacts from the polishing process (maximum diameter of 50 mm x thickness of 25 mm)\nRemove the surface or upper layers of multilayer film\nDiscriminate layers of the cross section for multilayer film (emphasizing irregularities)\nPreprocess large areas for EBSD (reducing irregularities)\nOptions\nCooling Temperature Control*1\n\nSensitive specimens can be cooled with liquid nitrogen during processing. The cooling temperature control uses indirect cooling and maintains a temperature during processing in order to prevent phase transitions.\nIn the example below, specimen cooling suppresses thermal deformation in the heat-sensitive styrene-based latex, resulting in a smooth processed surface.\n\n*1\nOption to deliver with the main unit\n\nSpecimen: Functional material to reduce plastic usage (Made of paper)\n\nRoom temperature milling\nCooling milling(-100 ℃)\nAir Protection Holder Unit\n\nThe Air Protection Holder can be used to keep air-sensitive specimens (such as battery material) isolated from the environment. A specimen fabricated using the IM4000II can be loaded into a SEM and/or Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) without exposure to the outside environment. This function can be used in combination with the cooling temperature control (except a flat-milling holder).\n\n*1\nCompatible only with Hitachi High-Tech FE-SEM with air protection holder unit.\n\n*2\nCompatible only with Hitachi High-Tech AFM with vacuum.\n\nStereo Microscope Unit for Process Observation\n\nA stereo microscope can be outfitted to observe the specimen during the milling process.

Moreover, it allows an even wider temperature range for Real View®. NEXTA DSCs also have ability to use temperature modulated DSC method to determine specific heat capacity. Together with the enhanced safety features designed in make this instrument even more user-friendly.\nThe series of DSCs provide cutting-edge measurement technology for quality control in various fields as well as research and development of polymers, inorganic materials, pharmaceuticals, and others.\n\nBrochure\nContact Us\nFeatures\nSpecifications\nVideo\nCitations\nFeatures\nWorld-class baseline repeatability\n\nBoth NEXTA DSC600 and DSC200 use an advanced heat-flow design in the sensor. This allows the heat from the heat sink transferred evenly to the sample and the reference, resulting in the high baseline stability. Together with a furnace built with a low-heat-capacity three-layered insulation design, this allows the NEXTA DSC achieves world-class baseline repeatability and stability.\n\nWorld-class sensitivity\n\nThe NEXTA DSC600 has a proprietary thermopile-type DSC sensor. By using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC signal) temperature sensor thermocouples connected in series and multiplexed, the NEXTA DSCs achieve a high sensitivity of 0.1 µW or lower, enabling measurement of even smaller samples.\n\nWider temperature range for Real View® DSC\n\nThe Real View Sample Observation Unit has a built-in two-megapixel high-resolution camera that supports visual observation of the sample. The viewport (observation window) has a heating mechanism that extends the measurement range from the conventionally observable range of room temperature and above down to the low temperature of -50°C. This enables the user to observe processes such as the crystallization and the glass transition, for example, of samples at low temperatures. This offers a unique capability for understanding material behavior.\n\nSpecific heat capacity determination by temperature modulated DSC method\n\nThe reversing heat flow (which shows glass transition and melting) and non-reversing heat flow (which shows enthalpy relaxation, curing, evaporation, decomposition, etc) are obtained from a modulated DSC measurement. This is useful when these transitions or reactions overlap or stress relief obscures a transition. The modulated DSC method can also be used for determining the specific heat capacity (Cp), which simplifies measuring Cp.\n\nSpecifications\n \tDSC600\tDSC200\nMeasurement principle\tHeat Flux\nTemperature range\t-150℃～725℃\nDSC dynamice range\t±100mW\t±200mW\nRMS noise / Sensitivity\t0.05μW/0.1μW\t0.1μW/0.2μW\nCalorimetric precision\t±0.05%\n* Calculated from the standard deviation (1σ/average value in In 10 consecutive measurement)\nBaseline repeatability\t±5μW\n* Electrical Cooling Unit : -50~300˚C, 10˚C/min\nProgrammable rate\t0.01℃～100℃/min\nPurge gas\tAir, Inert gas\nPurge gas control\tMass flow controller, 2 lines\nAuto Sampler *\tMax.50 samples\nElectrical Cooling Unit *\t-80℃～500℃\nAuto LN2 Gas Cooling Unit *\t-150℃～725℃\nAuto Air Cooling Unit *\tAmbient ～725℃\n\n*\nOptional\n\nVideo\nNEXTA DSC Video\nCitations\n Powered by Bioz © 2024\nSee more details on Bioz\nApplication Note \n\nApplications of thermal analysis and viscoelastic equipment.\n\nDescriptions \n\nDescribing the principles of thermal analysis and viscoelastic equipment.\n\nReal View® Sample Observation Unit \n\nUnderstand how your samples will perform with Hitachi thermal analyzers.\n\nSoftware for NEXTA \n\nThermal analysis software that features a guidance function and a new measurement mode that is very easy to use, even for beginners.\n\nOn-Demand Webinars \n\nOn-Demand Webinars for Thermal Analysis.\n\nStandards \n\nStandards of thermal analysis and viscoelastic equipment.\n\nReferences \n\nReferences and presentation documents regarding thermal analysis and viscoelasticity.\n\nScience Ring \n\nThe trademark that represents our strong bond with the customer and shows our pledge to connect science and society to create new value.\n\nTimeline \n\nTimeline of HITACHI Thermal Analysis Products.\n\nRelated Links\nApplication Note \nTechnical Support \nScience Ring \nBrochure\nBrochure\nContact Us\nContact Us\nPrevious Page\nBack to Top\n\nHitachi High-Tech\n\nHitachi High-Tech Global Top\n\nProducts & Services\nSearch by Product\nSearch by Industry\nSearch by Social Issues\nKnowledge\nSupport\nNews & Events\nAbout Us\nGroup Companies\nSustainability\nCareers\nHitachi Group Global Site\nProducts & SolutionsCorporate InformationGlobal NetworkContact Information\nHitachi GLOBAL Website\nTerms of Use Privacy Policy\n© Hitachi High-Tech Corporation. 2001, 2024.

With a lab-friendly footprint and intuitive touch screen, the second-generation ZONESEMII is a safe, easy-to-use addition to any laboratory.\n\nFeatures\nZONESEMII\n\nDesigned specifically for Hitachi specimen holders, the ZONESEMII provides optimized sample cleaning and storage modes of operation. The ZONESEMII serves as an excellent desiccator to prevent holder out-gassing.\n\nEasy-to-use touchscreen panel\nProgrammable up to 24hrs\nVariable pressure control\nCause of contamination\n\nInteractions between hydrocarbons on the specimen surface and the irradiated electron beam generate sample contamination. Hydrocarbons are generally non-covalently attached to the specimen surface during sample handling, preparation, and storage.\n\nCleaning Process\n\nThe ZONESEMII uses a UV lamp with wavelengths of 185 nm and 254 nm to efficiently remove hydrocarbons. Ozone is generated from oxygen in the vacuum-controlled specimen chamber, and generated ozone is broken into oxygen and activated oxygen. Hydrocarbons on the specimen surface are broken into volatile molecules such as CO2, H2O by radical oxygen and UV. The exhaust pump evacuates the free molecules from the sample chamber.\n\nApplication Data\nSample: Mesoporous Silica\nWithout “ZONESEMII” cleaning\nAfter “ZONESEMII” cleaning\nSample: ITO thin film on glass printed circuit board\nWithout “ZONESEMII” cleaning\nAfter “ZONESEMII” cleaning\nSample: Au Particles on Carbon\n\nZONESEMII enhances EDS analysis.\n\nSEM Image\n\nEDS Mapping Image\n\nWithout “ZONESEMII” cleaning\nAfter “ZONESEMII” cleaning\nSpecification\n\nSpecification\n\nDescription\nModel No.\tZONE-2010\nUV Lamp\tWavelengths: 184 nm, 254 nm\n\n(visible light, green and infrared light)\n\n\nSpecimen Size\t100 mm(D) × 37 mm(H)\nProcess Mode\tUV Cleaning mode, Vacuum storage mode\nVacuum Setting\tSettable by 100 phases of vacuum pressure\nProcess Setting Time\tOne minute to approximately 24 hours\nVacuum Pump\tDry vacuum exhaust system\nOzone exclusion\tBuilt-in Ozone exclusion device\nUnit Dimension\t310 mm(W) × 260 mm(D) × 305 mm(H)\nWeight\t18 kg\n\nSetting Condition\n\nDescription\n\nRoom Temperature\t15 - 30 degrees C\nHumidity\t≤ 70% (no condensing dew)\nPower Supply\tPower Supply: AC100 V - 240 V(±10%), 50/60 Hz 0.14 kVA\nnanoart \n\nPhoto collections of beauty of metals, minerals, organisms etc. reproduced by the electron microscope and finished more beautifully by computer graphic technology.\n\nRelated Product Categories\nField Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) \nScanning Electron Microscope (SEM) \nTabletop Microscope \nTransmission Electron Microscope (TEM) \nHitachi High-Tech Social Media\nContact Us\nContact Us\nPrevious Page\nBack to Top\n\nHitachi High-Tech\n\nHitachi High-Tech Global Top\n\nProducts & Services\nSearch by Product\nSearch by Industry\nSearch by Social Issues\nKnowledge\nSupport\nNews & Events\nAbout Us\nGroup Companies\nSustainability\nCareers\nHitachi Group Global Site\nProducts & SolutionsCorporate InformationGlobal NetworkContact Information\nHitachi GLOBAL Website\nTerms of Use Privacy Policy\n© Hitachi High-Tech Corporation. 2001, 2024.

The MC1000 is designed to deposit a thin metal coating, such as platinum (Pt), gold (Au), platinum-palladium alloy (Pt-Pd) or gold-palladium alloy (Au-Pd), in order to make the surface of a sample electrically conductive and avoid charge build-up during observation in a SEM. The thickness of the metal deposition is variable from a few nanometers up to tens of nanometers by using the LCD touch screen control. Up to 5 processing conditions can be stored.\n\nThe MC1000 operates via a magnetron electrode, which means a magnet is incorporated in the target (negative electrode) to generate a magnetic field perpendicular to the electric field on the target surface. This minimizes specimen damage due to irradiation with fast moving particles (including reflected ions) and allows coating with high granularity (smaller-diameter particles).\n\nFeatures\nOne-touch operation from the LCD touch panel\nSaves and recalls up to 5 recipes\nMagnetron-type electrode decreases specimen damage and reduces average particle size\nOptional chamber for samples up to 6 in (150 mm) in diameter\nOptional spacer for samples up to 1.75 in (45 mm) tall\nMain valve to keep the chamber under vacuum when not in use\nnanoart \n\nPhoto collections of beauty of metals, minerals, organisms etc. reproduced by the electron microscope and finished more beautifully by computer graphic technology.\n\nRelated Product Categories\nField Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) \nScanning Electron Microscope (SEM) \nTabletop Microscope \nTransmission Electron Microscope (TEM) \nHitachi High-Tech Social Media\nContact Us\nContact Us\nPrevious Page\nBack to Top\n\nHitachi High-Tech\n\nHitachi High-Tech Global Top\n\nProducts & Services\nSearch by Product\nSearch by Industry\nSearch by Social Issues\nKnowledge\nSupport\nNews & Events\nAbout Us\nGroup Companies\nSustainability\nCareers\nHitachi Group Global Site\nProducts & SolutionsCorporate InformationGlobal NetworkContact Information\nHitachi GLOBAL Website\nTerms of Use Privacy Policy\n© Hitachi High-Tech Corporation. 2001, 2024.

Furthermore, it establishes a benchmark for comprehensive environmental control and is the only tool on the market affording AFM imaging in air/liquid/vacuum, a broad temperature range (-120 °C to 800 °C), magnetic field or humidity controls, as well as correlated AFM/SEM/ion milling investigations.\n\nContact Us\nFeatures\nSpecifications\nCitations\nFeatures\n1. In response to environment measurement needs (supports optic system in air/continuous heating and cooling)\n\nThis environment control AFM measures within environments that cannot be realized by conventional large scale AFM units. The electronic measuring instrument under high vacuum conditions enables control to the lowest limits the effects of surface water and material mapping of samples under heating and cooling conditions. The newly developed “Temperature Sweep Function” makes possible continuous material measurement until the cantilever touches the sample surface by inspecting outside the Z axis measurement area due to thermal expansion or shrinkage of the sample by environment temperature change and feedback control. (Patent no. 3857581, Patent no. 3926638)\n\nin air\nin a liquid\nin a vacuum\ntemperature control\nhumidity control support\n2. Easy operation realized (integrated holder flange)\n\nBy employing the “Integrated holder flange open shut function” of unnecessary tools, together with simplifying the scanner replacement and introduction replacement of the sample, the optic axis adjustment after replacing the sample that resulted from the environment control AFM also became unnecessary. The holder does not need to be replaced when changing the measurement mode.\n\n3 .Superior performance\n\nEmploys a \"Swing Cancel\" Function. The swinging part of a sample is fully reduced and the drift amount controlled. Confidence increased by polishing the basic performance is indispensible to nano-order structural analysis. Drift amount: less than 0.015 nm/sec.\n\n4. Improves resolution of the electrical properties mode by reducing the influence of surface absorption water\n\nWhen observicing electrical characteristics, resolution in some cases may drop from the effects of moisture on the sample surface or probe. Moisture, contaminants, etc. on the surface is eliminated by going to vacuum status. Observation of high resolution and high sensitivity becomes possible in the material observation mode.\n\nSpecifications\nSpecifications\tAFM5300E\tOptional Accessories\nManual Stage\tXY ±2.5 mm\t \nSample Size\t25 mm (diameter)\nThickness: 10 mm\t \nScan range\n(Select at least one)\t20 µm × 20 µm × 1.5 µm\t100 µm × 100 µm × 15 µm\n150 µm × 150 µm × 5 µm\nClosed Loop Scanner\nXY 1.5 µm\nDetection\tOptical Lever\n(Low-coherence light)\t \nOptical Microscope\n*Top view\n(Select at least one)\tZoom Microscope\n(Lens magnification: x7)\nMetallurgical Microscope\n(Lens magnification: × 5, × 20, × 50)\t \nVibration Isolation\tFloor-model\t \nTemperature Control\t \t-120°C to 300°C\nR.T. to 800°C\nIn liquid:\nfrom R.T. to 60°C\nIn Liquid\t \t ✔\nHumidity Control\t \t20 to 80 %RH\nVacuum\t \tTurbo-molecular Pump & Rotary Pump (9.9x10-5Pa)\nCitations\nTopics\n\nArticle information on Hitachi technical magazine \"SI NEWS\"\n\nThis journal addresses a wide range variety of research papers and useful application data using Hitachi science instruments.

However, this flattening may distort a sample' s micro-surface structure, including its Z value. The newly developed AFM5500M is equipped with a flexure-based scanner that enables well-controlled raster scans along X and Y directions only. As a result, this advanced scanner design can effectively eliminate background curvatures in a wide scan area and improve the accuracy of AFM measurements.\n\nSample ：Amorphous silicon thin film on a silicon substrate\nHigh Orthogonality\n\nUsing a conventional piezoelectric tube scanner can cause cross-talk when bending the tube scanner.\nThis cross-talk leads to distortions and asymmetrization.

The electron beam accelerating voltage of the FESEM controls the probing depth or penetration level through the dielectric layers. A single probe is placed on the exposed, upper layer metallization to complete the circuit and allow the electrons to flow through the interconnect.\nObservation of high resistance and shorts due to Seebeck effect is possible by using dual probes along with the Hitachi patented differential EBAC amplifiers.\n\nUser-Friendly Design\nIntuitive GUI(Graphical User Interface) with various image and color processing functions.\nCoarse positioning of probes are accomplished by an integrated in-chamber CCD camera system.\nPremium Image Quality\nProvides high quality EBAC images with Hitachi's patented high performance EBAC amplifiers.\nOutstanding Performance\nField Proven, low chromatic aberration, Cold Field Emission (CFE) electron gun for low accelerating voltage imaging and beam damage reduction of the circuit.\nHigh precision nano-probe units.\nAdvanced Applications\nDedicated nano-probing system with EBAC analysis and electrical characteristics analysis.

They combine easy data acquisition through simple operation with much larger and heavier specimens than existing FE-SEMs. This makes it possible to observe large and heavy specimens including industrial materials such as iron and steel, automotive parts, and aerospace-related parts.\n\nFurthermore, the SE Series lineup offers four models (two types with two grades) to meet the measurement needs of a wide variety of fields.\n\nEach model provides unique capabilities; for example, the large-chamber models provide the best results for foreign matter and defect analysis, helping drive quality and yield. While the Plus models are ideal for the observation of fine surface structures, creating opportunities for improvements in electronic components and semiconductor manufacturing.\n\n*\nThe device photograph shows configuration with optional items.\n\nContact Us\nFeatures\nApplications Gallery\nSpecifications\nFeatures\n●Schottky SEM with large specimen chamber to expand application capabilities\n\nEvaluating shapes by electron microscopy is the foundation of all material evaluation and analysis. Demand has always existed for the ability to mount and observe specimens in their original shape.\n\nThe SU3900SE/SU3800SE Series Microscopes have a highly rigid multipurpose specimen chamber that makes it possible to mount specimens as is.\n\nThis eliminates the need to perform metal coating of non-conductive specimens and breaking or cutting large and heavy specimens, allowing observation from a wide variety of angles.\n\n●High resolution for improved top-surface imaging\n\nThe resolution has been improved at both high and low accelerating voltages by adopting a newly developed Schottky electron gun. An advanced model (SE Plus) is also available to meet the demand for fine observation of top surface detail.\n\nFurthermore, a low-accelerating-voltage high-sensitivity backscattered electron detector is included for obtaining composition and topographic information.\n\nThis makes it possible to perform a multifaceted analysis through acquisition of a wide range of information when combined with the optional ultra-variable-pressure detector (UVD).\n\n●Automation and support functions that improve usability\n\nThe SU3900SE/SU3800SE Series Microscopes are equipped with an automatic optical adjustment function that reduces manual work. This auto alignment sequence function eliminates the need to manually adjust the beam alignment, aperture alignment, focus, and stigmation. In addition, the EM Flow Creator is available to support automation of operations such as sequential image capture. A series of observation recipes can be created by setting parameters such as magnification, stage position, focus, and contrast adjustment, into blocks that can be combined, thus allowing the creation of customized recipes. Recipes can be created by dragging and dropping blocks into an arrangement like a flowchart. Automatic observation is possible by executing a created recipe.\n\nSpecimen observation example（Metal wire bonding）\n\n\n① Locate the area of interest and capture an image at x300.\n② Execute the template matching function on image ① to locate a new area of interest. Then center on the location, zoom in, and capture an image at x1,000.\n③ Execute the template matching function on image ② to locate a new area of interest. Then center on the location, zoom in, and capture an image at x5,000.\n\nApplications Gallery\n\nFracture surface of iron wire\nMicrocavitation due to ductile failure can be seen.\n\nSUS316\nLine-like contrast suggestive of dislocations can be seen.\n\nPrinted circuit board\nThe 3D shapes and positions of mounted components can be seen using low magnification/high-tilt observation.\n\nCross section of layered ceramic capacitor\nThe composition and crystal contrast of nickel electrodes/dielectric layer can be observed.\n\nZinc oxide particles\nFine particles with sizes of about 50 nm and 3D shape can be seen.\n\nHigh-entropy carbide film\nDistribution of particles with different compositions/shapes can be seen.\n\nLithium-ion battery cathode material\nDistributions of cathode material particles and surrounding binder can be seen.\n\nLithium-ion battery anode material\nlithium-ion battery anode material and binder is clearly distinguished using static voltage contrast.\n\nSpecifications\nItem\tSU3900SE/SE Plus\tSU3800SE/SE Plus\nElectron Optics\tSecondary Electron Image resolution\t0.9 nm@30 kV\n2.5 nm@1 kV\n1.6 nm@1 kV (*1) (*2)\nMagnification\t5～600,000×\nElectron Gun\tZrO/W Schottky Emitter\nAccelerating Voltage\t0.5 kV～30 kV\nLanding Voltage (*1) (*2)\t0.1 kV～2 kV\nProbe Current\tMax. 150 nA\nPressure Range\tVariable Pressure (VP) mode\t6 to 150 Pa\nDetectors\tStandard Detectors\tSecondary Electron Detector (SED)\nTOP detector (TD) (*2)\n41+1-segment Semiconductor Type Backscattered Electron Detector (BSED)\nOptional Detector (*3)\tUltra Variable Pressure Detector (UVD)\nSpecimen Stage\tStage Control\t5-axis Motor Drive\nMovable Range\nX\t0～150 mm\t0～100 mm\nY\t0～150 mm\t0～50 mm\nZ\t3～85 mm\t3～65 mm\nT\t-20～90°\n\t\tR\t360°\nSpecimen Chamber\tMountable Specimen Size\tMax. φ 300 mm\tMax. φ 200 mm\n\n*1\nwith deceleration mode\n\n*2\navailable only for SE Plus specification\n\n*3\nOption\n\nCitations\n Powered by Bioz\nSee more details on Bioz\nRelated Information\nHitachi High-Tech Social Media\nContact Us\nContact Us\nPrevious Page\nBack to Top\n\nHitachi High-Tech\n\nHitachi High-Tech Global Top\n\nProducts & Services\nSearch by Product\nSearch by Industry\nSearch by Social Issues\nKnowledge\nSupport\nNews & Events\nAbout Us\nGroup Companies\nSustainability\nCareers\nHitachi Group Global Site\nProducts & SolutionsCorporate InformationGlobal NetworkContact Information\nHitachi GLOBAL Website\nTerms of Use Privacy Policy\n© Hitachi High-Tech Corporation. 2001, 2024.

It features unique electron optics, with the sample positioned inside a gap between the upper and lower parts of the objective lens pole piece. This so-called true in-lens concept - combined with the next generation of HITACHI's cold field emission technology - guarantees the highest possible system resolution (SE resolution 0.4 nm @ 30 kV, 0.7 nm @1.0 kV [with deceleration feature option]) and stability.\n\nNew coherent cold field emission source \n\nTo make this resolving power usable in practical applications in your lab, the SU9000II utilizes an ultra-stable side-entry sample stage similar to high-end TEM systems and incorporates optimized vibration damping and a closed cabinet to shield the electron optics from environmental noise. Furthermore, the clean vacuum concept of the SU9000II offers a vacuum level in the gun and sample chamber that is one order of magnitude better than the previous generation, thereby minimizing sample contamination artifacts (effective pre-observation cleaning of the samples themselves can be achieved using Hitachi's ZONESEM sample cleaner).\n\nSample Cleaner ZONESEMⅡ \n\nTo allow for stable data acquisition at the instrument‘s highest performance levels, the SU9000II offers new capabilities that render automated adjustments of the optical system—and the new EM Flow Creator software package as an option to render automated data acquisition, particularly sequential data collection.\n\nSample : ArF Resist\nVacc : 500 V\nSignal : SE image\nWith beam deceleration\nLow-aberration in-lens objective lens\n\nIn-lens type objective lens has the advantage of reducing aberration by shortening the focal length. Reduced aberration can improve the resolution, allowing more stable observations for fine structures at the sub-10 nm scale or even below.\nThe figure on the left shows a backscattered-electron image of an ion-milled cross section of a PMOS transistor after cleaving.\nThe backscattered-electron signal clearly reveals information on the cross-sectional composition of the device, including the e-SiGe morphology.\n\nSpecimen: PMOS transistor\nBackscattered electron image\nAccelerating voltage: 1 kV\nMagnification: 500 kX\nExploring new possibilities in LV STEM\nAngle-selective Dark-Field STEM image\n\n- BF/DF Duo-STEM detector(option) -\n\nLattice imaging by SEM/STEM\n\nThe SU9000II features a low-aberration in-lens objective lens and an optical system optimized for STEM observations. These features expand the range of available SEM/STEM observation techniques.\nBy controlling the convergence angle of the primary electron beam and generating interference fringes on the detection plane of transmitted electrons, lattice images can be observed in SEM/STEM.\nThe figure on the right shows a bright-field STEM image of pyrophyllite, revealing (020) plane lattice fringes with spacings of 0.445 nm.\n\nFeatures\nThe world's highest SE resolution of 0.4 nm at 30 kV is guaranteed.\nUsable magnification of up to 3,000,000x.\nNewly designed CFE GUN provides high brightness and an extremely stable emission current.\nSuperior low kV performance for observing beam sensitive materials. The SE resolution of 0.7 nm even at 1.0 kV landing voltage (with deceleration feature option) is guaranteed.\nNewly capabilities that render automated adjustments of the optical system and an optional function that render automated data acquisition allow sequential data collection.\nImproved vacuum technology that allows for UHV levels for reduced sample contamination.\nHighly engineered instrument enclosure featuring both superior strength and stability to allow for high resolution imaging in a broad range of environmental conditions.\nNewly designed objective lens enables high resolution imaging at a low acceleration voltage.\nSide entry sample exchange system increases throughput by reducing the time required to change samples and automatically positioning the sample at the current WD.\nIn-lens SEM\n\nS-900 launched with 1,000 units installed.\nIn 1986, Hitachi released the S-900, the world's first commercial in-lens FE-SEM. With 0.8 nm SE resolution and a usable magnification of up to 800.000x, the new concept of the S-900 truly opened up a new world for researchers in many fields.\n\nThe success story continued with the S-5000 (1990), S-5200 (2000) and S-5500 (2004), with each new model setting new standards.\n\nIn 2011 Hitachi celebrated 25 years of in-lens FE-SEM technology, and used that opportunity to introduce the new SU9000, the most powerful member in Hitachi's high-end FE-SEM product line-up.\n\nLV-STEM\nHigh-Resolution, Analytical STEM/SEM Providing Simultaneous Chemical and Bonding Analysis, Atomic Resolution, and Surface Imaging at 30kV and below\n\nInvestigating samples with the full capabilities of STEM at 30 keV and below is an extremely interesting and rapidly growing area of research: providing both Materials and Life Sciences with full SEM and STEM, inclusive EDX, and EELS capabilities, at low voltages. Less beam damage and higher contrast are the key arguments for the Low-Voltage STEM (LV-STEM), a capability that has been out of reach for researchers globally. With the LV-STEM, its low beam energy, increased contrast, and narrow energy spread, investigations of biological material in an unstained condition are becoming a reality for the first time.\n\nSince the STEM unit has no imaging lens after the sample, electrons that were inelastically scattered by the sample do not really worsen image quality (they do for TEM). The significance of the lack of chromatic aberrations after the sample increases with decreasing electron energy; samples that typically would require a 100-keV TEM, at the very least, can be investigated with low-keV STEM. Multi-scattering processes and absorption of course still appear—ultimately limiting the acceptable thickness of the specimen. However, the use of high-end specimen preparation techniques, or working with thin samples as is typical in nano-research fields, allows 30-keV STEMs to cover much of the areas of conventional higher-keV TEMs, while at the same time, providing surface information through standard SEM methods, including SE, BSE, and high-angle BSE.\n\nThe well-established cold FEG of Hitachi’s high-end SEMs is a tremendous benefit for EELS capabilities as well as the point resolution of STEM. Despite the unusually low voltage for EELS and the increased impact of environmental conditions on low-voltage electrons, we are able to demonstrate better than 400-meV FWHM (full width half maximum, see Figure 1, left) for the ZLP (zero loss peak) of EELS, allowing clear and crisp EELS data for fine structure investigations. For example, eliciting the tiny changes in the π bonding for the Graphene as layer after layer is added demonstrates the sensitivity of the LV-STEM (see Figure 1, right). The LV-STEM also has a 2nd dedicated EELS detector with 3 elements, allowing the rapid (10,000 fps) acquisition of energy-filtered BF STEM images, Plasmon images, or the rapid collection of elemental maps. Switching between both detectors is easy and relies on Hitachi’s own unique design.\n\nThe LV-STEM feature (Figure 2) complements SE imaging and makes no compromise. Typical images taken at 30 keV without a Cs corrector or Cc corrector approach 0.2-nm resolution establishing the LV-STEM as the true performance leader for ≤ 30 keV microscopy. The importance of simultaneously acquiring STEM and SE data is demonstrated in Figure 3.\n\nAs this microscope can handle samples up to 5.0 mm × 9.5 mm × 3.5 mm, the optional windowless EDX detector supports the analysis of both thin and bulk areas. At an incredible collection angle of 0.7 sr, acquisition times for EDX maps are short (see details in Figure 4), making the LV-STEM a truly ground-breaking microscope for both Materials and Life Sciences applications.\n\nReferences\n\nR.F.

An integrated liquid nitrogen dewar connected to the cross-section stage effectively removes heat induced during ion-beam milling from the shielding mask and sample.\n\n*\nFactory fit only\n\n- The digital Cryo Temperature Control (CTC) unit allows operators to set a desired cooling temperature by placing a heater and sensor directly at the cross-section shielding mask so that a desired process temperature can be accurately maintained.\n\n- At the conclusion of cryo-milling, the specimen stage is gently warmed up to room temperature in order to avoid ice formation or water condensation on the sample surface.\n\n- Sample cooling can support damage-free cross-section milling of highly temperature-sensitive specimen such as polymers or soft metals. However, even with active cooling applied, it is important to choose proper processing parameters for best results. This is especially important for samples with low thermal conductivity because the heat generated at the direct ion-beam point of impact must first be effectively conducted to other regions of the specimen. The ArBlade 5000 with CTC provides high ion-beam currents even at lower \"gentle\" accelerating voltages and is, therefore, optimally suited for this and other processing techniques.\n\nSpecimen : wood alloy\n\nWithout cooling\nWith cooling\nTechnical Explanation\n\nArticle information on Hitachi technical magazine \"SI NEWS\"\n\nHitachi‘s State-of-the-Art Ion Milling Systems \nSpecification\nDescription\nGas used\tAr(argon) gas\nAccelerating voltage\t0 to 8 kV\nCross-section Milling\nMaximum milling rate(Material: Si)\t≥ 1 mm/h*1\nMaximum milling width\t8 mm (with using a wide-area cross-sectional milling holder)\nMaximum sample size\t20(W) × 12(D) × 7(H) mm\nSample moving range\tX ±7 mm, Y 0 to +3 mm\nIon beam intermittent irradiation\tStandard function\nSwing angle\t±15°, ±30°, ±40°\nFlat Milling\nMilling area\tφ32 mm\nMaximum sample size\tφ50 × 25(H) mm\nSample moving range\tX 0 to +5 mm\nIon beam intermittent irradiation\tStandard function\nRotation speed\t1 rpm, 25 rpm\nTilt\t0 to 90°\n\n*1\nSi protrudes 100 µm from the mask edge.\n\nOptional\nItem\tDescription\nCooling temperature control*2\tIndirectly cooling by LN2, Range of set temperature : 0 to -100°C\nHigher beam tolerance mask\tIt is twice as hard as the standard mask.\nZoom stereo microscope unit\t15 to 100 magnifications, Binocular type, Trinocular tyoe (correspond to CCD camera)\n\n*2\nFactory fit only\n\nCitations\n Powered by Bioz © 2024\nSee more details on Bioz\nnanoart \n\nPhoto collections of beauty of metals, minerals, organisms etc. reproduced by the electron microscope and finished more beautifully by computer graphic technology.\n\nRelated Product Categories\nField Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM) \nScanning Electron Microscope (SEM) \nTabletop Microscope \nTransmission Electron Microscope (TEM) \nRelated Information\nHitachi High-Tech Social Media\nContact Us\nContact Us\nPrevious Page\nBack to Top\n\nHitachi High-Tech\n\nHitachi High-Tech Global Top\n\nProducts & Services\nSearch by Product\nSearch by Industry\nSearch by Social Issues\nKnowledge\nSupport\nNews & Events\nAbout Us\nGroup Companies\nSustainability\nCareers\nHitachi Group Global Site\nProducts & SolutionsCorporate InformationGlobal NetworkContact Information\nHitachi GLOBAL Website\nTerms of Use Privacy Policy\n© Hitachi High-Tech Corporation. 2001, 2024.

Therefore, the number of neutrons generated from the treatment system is extremely low, which reduces the thickness of the shielding walls.\n\nHigh system availability\n\nWhen urgent maintenance of the system is required, the maintenance staff can enter the equipment room without having to wait for the neutrons to decay, providing a higher treatment throughput for hospitals.\n\nEasier decommissioning\n\nDecommission of a particle therapy system may become an issue after many years of use.

Heavy-ion is said to have a better dose concentration than proton, with 2-3 times greater in killing effect on cancer cells. This effect can reduce the number of fractions and shorten the treatment period.\nHeavy-ion therapy is also expected to be effective against cancers which are resistant to conventional x-ray radiation therapy such as sarcoma and adenocarcinoma, locally advanced cancers, and deep-seated cancers.\n\n*1 Heavy-ion beam:\nIn a broad sense, heavy ion beams include beams of any particles that are heavier than electrons. In Japanese heavy ion radiotherapy, the term \"heavy ion beam\" indicates a nucleus (heavy ion) beam of any atom that is heavier than helium (He), or that has an atomic number larger than that of helium. For almost 20 years in Japan, carbon ion beams have been used for heavy ion beam therapy.

By irradiating the lesion location with the aligned Bragg peak, the dose concentration is focused on the lesion leading to minimal side effect on the surrounding healthy tissues.\nTherefore, compared with traditional radiation therapy, particle therapy can lead to fewer side effects and patients can expect a higher quality of life after treatment. Behind the widespread use of particle therapy is the advancement of highly accurate irradiation control technology and dose planning / management technology for particle beams.\nHitachi has contributed to the technological development of particle therapy.\n\n※This diagram is made based on the explanatory figure by the Particle Radiotherapy Promotion Group (P-RAP).（https://www.particle.or.jp/hirtjapan/en/medical/about/merit.html)\nMajor indications for Particle Therapy\n※Refer to the websites of Hospitals linked to the web page of Association for Nuclear Technology in Medicine （http://www.antm.or.jp/05_treatment/04.html)\n※For inquiries regarding treatment, please contact each medical institution.\n*1 PMDA Approval No.： 23100BZX00051000\nContact Us\nContact Us Form\nBack to Top\n\nHitachi High-Tech\n\nHitachi High-Tech Global Top\n\nProducts & Services\nSearch by Product\nSearch by Industry\nSearch by Social Issues\nKnowledge\nSupport\nNews & Events\nAbout Us\nGroup Companies\nSustainability\nCareers\nHitachi Group Global Site\nProducts & SolutionsCorporate InformationGlobal NetworkContact Information\nHitachi GLOBAL Website\nTerms of Use Privacy Policy\n© Hitachi High-Tech Corporation. 2001, 2024.

Lithium-ion batteries, *1 the power source for electric vehicles, degrade with use over time. However, it is difficult to determine in detail how much a battery has degraded. To address this issue, Hitachi High-Tech has developed the Rapid Diagnostics of Battery Degradation Method, which can diagnose battery degradation immediately.\n\nLEARN MORE \nStories of Solving Social Issues: The Woodlands of Hitachi High-Tech Science\n\nNatural Symbiosis Society | Preservation of biological multiplicity | Recycling-oriented society\nOur planet is home to many organisms, but due to the effects of climate change and the deterioration of the natural environment, this biodiversity is being lost day-by-day. Over the past 50 years, the world's biodiversity has decreased by 68% (Source: \"Living Planet Report 2020\"). To help solve the issues with biodiversity, the Hitachi High-Tech Group launched the \"Biodiversity Project\" in 2015 at the Woodlands of Hitachi High-Tech Science on the grounds of Hitachi High-Tech Science's Fuji Oyama Works (Oyama, Shizuoka Prefecture).\n\nLEARN MORE \nManaging Chemical Substances Appropriately to Ensure a Healthy Global Environment for Future Generations\n\nHealthy living\nIn order to protect human health and the global environment, regulations governing the management of harmful chemical substances are becoming stricter around the world. For example, REACH regulation in the EU, TSCA (Toxic Substances Control Act) in the US, and the Chemical Substances Control Law in Japan. While cooperation from suppliers is essential in managing the chemical substances contained in products, with thousands of chemical types, it is not easy to keep track of these. In response, in order to properly manage chemical substances while reducing the burden on suppliers, the Hitachi High-Tech Group has developed chemNEXT, a cloud-based, fixed-price service for managing chemical substances contained in products. The service launched in February 2021 and supports safe and transparent manufacturing.\n\nLEARN MORE \nSupporting the Shift to EVs with Observation, Measurement and Analysis Technologies\n\nImproving the efficiency of production sites | Decarbonation\nDue to the ongoing crisis of climate change, both Japan and the wider world are rapidly shifting toward electric vehicles (EVs). The demand for lithium-ion batteries (LiB), used as storage batteries in EVs, has increased rapidly, with the market for automotive lithium-ion batteries reaching 6 trillion yen over the past five years. Hitachi High-Tech aims to contribute to a sustainable global environment by providing manufacturing facilities for safe, long-lasting batteries and quality control services to manufacturers that develop and manufacture lithium-ion batteries, contributing to the proliferation of EVs and supporting measures to combat climate change.\n\nLEARN MORE \nSolving Material Development Bottlenecks With AI to Enhance Industrial Capabilities and Build a Sustainable Future\n\nImproving the efficiency of production sites | Science and industrial development\nClimate change, resource exhaustion and environmental pollution are all challenges that we face today. For example, plastic does not break down in the natural environment and, if things are left as they are, it is predicted that the amount of plastic waste in the oceans by 2050 will exceed the amount of fish.\nOne way to solve these challenges is to develop sustainable alternatives. Materials Informatics (MI) from our Materials Solutions Division offers solutions for the fast-paced development of materials. We are able to achieve higher efficiencies by using AI in processes that have traditionally relied heavily on experienced researchers, including research, design and simulation.\n\nLEARN MORE \nHitachi High-Technologies Has Its Eyes on Safe and Reliable Water Infrastructure\n\nImproving the efficiency of production sites | Healthy living\nDelicious water at the turn of a faucet, and reliable sewerage systems to drain the water. The Hitachi Group has long been involved in providing mechanical and electrical equipment for water and sewerage facilities in order to maintain water and sewerage systems—social infrastructure that supports people's daily lives. Hitachi High-Tech Solutions is responsible for one part of the monitoring system that is core to these facilities. Introducing \"Water and Sewerage Solutions,\" which contributes to society through the development of advanced technologies, guided by our mission to provide a steady supply of safe and reliable water.\n\nLEARN MORE \nAI Accelerates New Materials Development, Contributing to the Development of Chemistry, Industry, and Environmental Conservation\n\nImproving the efficiency of production sites | Science and industrial development\nThe transition to a carbon neutral economy is a pressing issue in the work to achieve a sustainable society. As a field, chemistry will play a significant role toward that end, notably in the development of more environmentally friendly materials.\nHitachi High-Tech Solutions Chemicals Informatics is a search service that uses AI to find necessary compounds for materials development. Using a database with over 100 million entries, it enables users to perform comprehensive searches by supporting them in finding a compound that suits their application.\nAI handles a part of the work that used to be heavily dependent on experienced chemists in order to enable major reductions in R&D time, labor and costs. The service will play a role in providing society with new materials as swiftly as possible.\n\nLEARN MORE \nRoHS Application-Compliant Equipment Data Acquisition System\n\nImproving the efficiency of production sites | Science and industrial development | Healthy living\nRefrigerators, washing machines, computers and game consoles. We are surrounded by countless electronics in our day-to-day lives. And all of these electronics are made using a wide variety of materials. While some materials contribute to economic growth and social development, they can also be a source of air and soil pollution, or have negative impacts on human health if not managed properly. With environmental regulations restricting the use of hazardous substances growing more rigorous — with the RoHS Directive foremost — Hitachi High-Tech Science began sales of its \"RoHS Application-Compliant Equipment Data Acquisition System\" in November 2021. This system helps to tighten controls on hazardous substances, supporting companies in their progress toward sustainable manufacturing.\n\nLEARN MORE \nSupport \nAnalytical Systems\nElectron Microscope/Probe Microscope\nHealthcare\nSemiconductor Manufacturing Equipment\nMeasurement control systems\nNews & Events\nNews\nJul 25, 2024\n Products & Services News Releases\nHitachi High-Tech and National Taiwan University Established a Joint Facility for Electron Microscopes Contributing to the Development of Science and Technology in Taiwan\nMay 28, 2024\n Products & Services News Releases\nHitachi High-Tech Launches the SU3900SE and SU3800SE Series High-Resolution Schottky Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopes Allowing Observation of Large and Heavy Samples at the Nano Level\nMay 20, 2024\n Products & Services News Releases\nHitachi High-Tech and Hitachi have started collaborating on digital transformation of materials development with ITRI, contributing to improvements of Taiwan's industrial standards\nMore News \nPrevious Page\nBack to Top\n\nHitachi High-Tech\n\nHitachi High-Tech Global Top\n\nProducts & Services\nSearch by Product\nSearch by Industry\nSearch by Social Issues\nKnowledge\nSupport\nNews & Events\nAbout Us\nGroup Companies\nSustainability\nCareers\nHitachi Group Global Site\nProducts & SolutionsCorporate InformationGlobal NetworkContact Information\nHitachi GLOBAL Website\nTerms of Use Privacy Policy\n© Hitachi High-Tech Corporation. 2001, 2024.

Then it spreads worldwide.\nIn Japan, the Information Technology Initiative for Materials and Materials Development was launched in 2015, and Hitachi, Ltd. started to provide material development solutions in 2017. *2\n\nSince MI is a data-driven development, we will be able to take the data and make the next move, rather than relying on the experience and intuition as in the past. It can be applied not only in material development but also in various fields, and we can expect to improve the efficiency of development.\n\nDIFFERENCES BETWEEN TRADITIONAL DEVELOPMENT METHODS AND MI IMPLEMENTATION\n\nUntil now, the mainstream method of material development has been to plan experimental designs based on the intuition of researchers based on their intuition and experience, conduct experiments, and evaluate properties.\nHowever, this method has the disadvantages of being unrepeatable and individualistic to non-specific researchers, and of being costly and time-consuming due to the high number of experiments.\n\nMaterials Informatics can use computational science techniques from past experimental data to predict target performance without experimentation.\nPast experimental data include materials and mix ratios of materials and process conditions. Based on these, it becomes possible to build machine learning models and develop experimental design supplements.\n\n\nBecause of data-driven research, it doesn't require a specific researcher to do, and that can lead to cost and time reduction.\n\nMI of Hitachi High-Tech \nMI CHALLENGES\n\nCommon challenges in practicing development with Materials Informatics are \"insufficient data volume\" and \"insufficient data quality.\"\nSome will have adoption difficulty cases like \"We can't prepare the data right now for MI.\"\n\nData complements will be needed to solve these challenges.\nHitachi High-Tech's material development solutions can supplement data by text mining, which converts data from published patents and papers, or by using simulation and descriptors.\n\n\nA growing number of companies have also introduced databases in materials development.\nData that tends to be stored separately can be centralized, data sharing is made more efficient, analysis is made easier from a data science perspective, and new materials can be developed by utilizing them in MI.\n\nMI UTILIZED AREA\nMaterial development chemistry (Organic/Inorganic): Optimum mix of industrial components\nProduct development: Semiconductor (Wafer, Pzukhotoresist, etc.) Lithium-ion batteries (Cathode materials, Electrolytes, Separators, etc.)\nMedical care: Image analysis such as X-ray and MRI, Development of prosthetic devices, etc.\nDrug discovery: Biopharmaceutical Development, Genomic discovery, etc.\nAquaculture and marine resources: Efficiency and measurement technologies for aquaculture\nAgriculture: Next-generation crops\n\nThe above is just a few of examples. MI is used in many different areas around the world.\n\nMI×SDGS\n\nMaterial development is critical to achieving the SDGs.\nTo achieve a sustainable society, it is necessary to innovate materials toward a carbon-neutral, decarbonized society.\n\n\nRealizing Society 5.0, strengthening the research base and DX, economic growth, and environmental protection through GX will make MI an essential component.\n\nFor example, in order to rapidly promote the development of environmentally friendly bioplastics and biodegradable plastics, and the development of materials for energy transport and conversion, it will be necessary to change conventional development methods.\n\nIn addition, if the company shift from their people-oriented development methods to data-driven development, they can solve the problem of human resources to sustain their business over the long term.\n\nTo achieve a sustainable society, MI is an inseparable solution.\n\nMI of Hitachi High-Tech \nStrengths of Hitachi High-Tech \nMI success stories \nCONTACT　US\nReferences\n\n*1\nMaterial Genome Initiative\n\n*2\n経済産業省　マテリアル革新力強化のための政府戦略に向けて\n\nPrevious Page\nBack to Top\n\nHitachi High-Tech\n\nHitachi High-Tech Global Top\n\nProducts & Services\nSearch by Product\nSearch by Industry\nSearch by Social Issues\nKnowledge\nSupport\nNews & Events\nAbout Us\nGroup Companies\nSustainability\nCareers\nHitachi Group Global Site\nProducts & SolutionsCorporate InformationGlobal NetworkContact Information\nHitachi GLOBAL Website\nTerms of Use Privacy Policy\n© Hitachi High-Tech Corporation. 2001, 2024.

They are used in a wide variety of fields from metals/ceramics/semiconductors to polymers/biological tissues.\nTEM and STEM are used to observe internal structure by detecting electrons transmitted through a thin specimen while SEM is used to observe surface structure by detecting electrons generated upon primary electron beam irradiation on the surface of a sample.\n\nLearn More \nFocused Ion Beam Systems\n(FIB*4/FIB-SEM)\n\nFIB is used to observe surface structure by detecting electrons generated upon ion beam irradiation and process the surface of a sample to an arbitrary shape by the use of focused ion beam. Since the ion beam can arbitrarily scan on a sample, FIB is widely used for site-specific cross section preparation for SEM observation and lamella preparation for TEM observation. FIB-SEM incorporates both FIB and SEM in a single system, and allows in-situ SEM observation of FIB-prepared cross section. By repeating FIB milling and SEM observation, serial cross-sectional SEM images can be collected and reconstructed for further three-dimensional structural analysis of the sample.\n\nLearn More \nAtomic Force Microscopes (AFM)\n\nInnovative Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) products offering extraordinary levels of performance, value, and ease-of-use for a wide range of application from surface topography to a wide variety of nanoscale surface property measurements\n\nLearn More \nSample Preparation\n\nIon milling system to prepare wide cross section of a sample, ion sputter to increase the conductivity of non-conductive sample and sample cleaner to reduce contamination which disturb electron microscope observation.\n\nLearn More \n\n*1\nScanning Electron Microscope\n\n*2\nTransmission Electron Microscope\n\n*3\nScanning Transmission Electron Microscope\n\n*4\nFocused Ion Beam systems\n\nRelated topics\n\n“S.I.navi” is Hitachi Membership Site for analytical instruments users.\n“S.I.navi” provides helpful information for daily analysis.\n\nHitachi Membership Site, “S.I.navi” \nHitachi Membership Site, “S.I.navi”, login page \nHitachi Membership Site, “S.I.navi”, membership registration form (FOR FREE) \nHitachi High-Tech Social Media\nPrevious Page\nBack to Top\n\nHitachi High-Tech\n\nHitachi High-Tech Global Top\n\nProducts & Services\nSearch by Product\nSearch by Industry\nSearch by Social Issues\nKnowledge\nSupport\nNews & Events\nAbout Us\nGroup Companies\nSustainability\nCareers\nHitachi Group Global Site\nProducts & SolutionsCorporate InformationGlobal NetworkContact Information\nHitachi GLOBAL Website\nTerms of Use Privacy Policy\n© Hitachi High-Tech Corporation. 2001, 2024.
