It is therefore important to work to improve the safety and efficiency of dump trucks. In addition, by automating patrol vehicles traveling around the mine, operators can expect to reduce the risk of accidents that occur when transporting replacement parts and supplies.\n\nConceptual image of the application of autonomous driving for mining patrol vehicles\nFactories\n\nThe introduction of autonomous vehicles is expected to be effective in conveyance / transportation using trucks at factories covering wide areas, such as those producing cars, steel and other heavy industries. For example, in addition to being a viable measure against labor shortages for truck drivers, it is also effective for simple round-trip work of only a few hundred meters between facilities on the premises. Autonomous driving suitable for outdoor mobility on the premises is a new solution to areas that cannot be covered by AGVs.\n※AGV：Automatic Guided Vehicle\n\nConceptual image of conveyance between factories and warehouses by autonomous driving trucks\nPorts\n\nTruck transportation between port quays and container yards can be expected to see various benefits from the introduction of autonomous driving vehicles. For example, they will reduce the risk of occupational accidents for workers in areas where many pieces of heavy machinery operate, improve price competitiveness by reducing labor costs, and prevent problems such as equipment and vehicle damage due to misconduct and operating errors. In particular, the main motivation for considering automation is the labor shortage of truck drivers at ports.\n\nConceptual image of application of autonomous driving at ports\nTransport Operators\n\nIn the transportation field, operators can expect to see benefits from introducing automation with BRT. Due to changes in social structure caused by the COVID-19 epidemic, the number of rail and bus users is decreasing. Unmanned BRT systems with smaller capital investment than railways that can dynamically dispatch and operate based on demand may be a means of supporting future public transportation.\n※BRT：Bus Rapid Transit\n\nConceptual image of application of autonomous driving in BRT\n\nRelated Contents\n\nCareers\n\nStories\n\nMotorsports\n\nHitachi Astemo, Ltd.\n\nNews Release\n\nCompany Information\n\nMessage from the President & CEO\nCompany Name & Brand\nCompany Overview\nFacilities\nHistory\nIR Materials\nHitachi Astemo in Numbers\nExhibition\nCompany Profile\n\nTechnologies\n\nResearch and Development\nMonozukuri\n\nSystems/Products\n\nAutonomous Driving / Advanced Driver Assistance Systems\nConnected\nSoftware\nPowertrain Systems\nChassis Systems\nMotorcycle Systems\nAftermarket Products\nPower Products & Industrial Equipment\n\nStories\n\nGroup Overview\n\nAmericas\nJapan\nEurope\nChina\nAsia\n\nSustainability\n\nEnvironmental Activities\nRelationship with Society\nPeople\nCorporate Governance\n\nCareers\n\nGermany/German\nMexico/Spanish\nFrance/French\nThailand/Thai\n\nMotorsports\n\nSitemap Contact Us\nSocial Media Accounts\nAccessibility Policy Terms of Use Privacy Policy Cookie Policy and Settings\n© Hitachi Astemo, Ltd. 2024.

Cyber security is becoming a pressing concern, and to counter this threat we see the standardization of regulations, such as with WP29. Hitachi Astemo delivers reliable services through partner collaboration and the comprehensive capabilities that encompass automotive, IT and security.\n\nWP29 and Standardization\nSecurity Standard Creation Trends in the Chinese Automotive Industry\n\nProviding WP29-compliant security services as a one-stop solution\n\nIn recent years, there have been cases where manufacturers have been forced to recall cars due to cyberattacks such as remote operation of driving functions from outside, due to the fact that cars are connected to various systems. In light of this situation, international standards on cybersecurity have been established and responses are required, primarily in Japan and Europe. In Japan, compliance with laws and regulations will be compulsory for vehicles starting production in 2022, and it is said that security standards will be mandatory by around 2025. Vehicle security measures will be applied both during manufacturing and operation. For automobile manufacturers, compliance will be required at both organizational and vehicle lifecycle levels.\n\nSecurity Solutions for Connected Cars\n\nSIEM：Security Information and Event Management\nIVI：In-vehicle Infotainment\nOBD：On-board Diagnostics\nECU：Electrical Control Unit\n\nMonitoring logs are distributed to each ECU based on vehicle-wide threat analysis. Gateway performs integrated chronological analysis of logs to accurately detect signs of attack at an early stage. False and over-detections are also reduced, reducing the operational load on the SOC side and achieving cost optimization.\n\nCybersecurity monitoring systems to match vehicle and cloud systems\n\nHitachi Astemo leverages its automobile, IT and security experience to address issues unique to automobiles and security. Its connected car security monitors logs of vehicles, data centers and mobile devices in real time, quickly detecting attacks to minimize damage. We provide the systems necessary for connected car security (from in-car systems to cloud-side systems) together with operators and analysts trained and certified by Hitachi Astemo, while performing monitoring and analysis operations. Flexibly working with vehicle manufacturers and their different systems, we quickly and reliably support connected car security, from incident detection to reporting to certification organizations.\n\nReducing operational load and costs through proprietary in-car IDS with a low rate of false detection\n\nOn the vehicle side, we design and distribute monitoring logs while providing software that efficiently collects logs from vehicles to monitoring systems. Integrated analysis of logs collected in the gateway are used to infer attack scenarios and detect signs of attack in the initial stages, when hackers break in from outside the vehicle. Hitachi Astemo's proprietary in-car IDS (Intrusion Detection System) has fewer false and excess detections, reducing the operational load on the SOC side for both the system and its operators—enabling costs to be kept at a minimum.\n\nRelated Contents\n\nCareers\n\nStories\n\nMotorsports\n\nHitachi Astemo, Ltd.\n\nNews Release\n\nCompany Information\n\nMessage from the President & CEO\nCompany Name & Brand\nCompany Overview\nFacilities\nHistory\nIR Materials\nHitachi Astemo in Numbers\nExhibition\nCompany Profile\n\nTechnologies\n\nResearch and Development\nMonozukuri\n\nSystems/Products\n\nAutonomous Driving / Advanced Driver Assistance Systems\nConnected\nSoftware\nPowertrain Systems\nChassis Systems\nMotorcycle Systems\nAftermarket Products\nPower Products & Industrial Equipment\n\nStories\n\nGroup Overview\n\nAmericas\nJapan\nEurope\nChina\nAsia\n\nSustainability\n\nEnvironmental Activities\nRelationship with Society\nPeople\nCorporate Governance\n\nCareers\n\nGermany/German\nMexico/Spanish\nFrance/French\nThailand/Thai\n\nMotorsports\n\nSitemap Contact Us\nSocial Media Accounts\nAccessibility Policy Terms of Use Privacy Policy Cookie Policy and Settings\n© Hitachi Astemo, Ltd. 2024.

An original magnetic circuit design adjusts fuel supply volume, while a cleverly designed orifice plate allows for a variety of engine port injection configurations. This results in a product that can be installed in a wide range of vehicle models.\n\nECU: Electronic Control Unit\n\nThrottle Body\n\nA throttle position sensor installed on the throttle axis detects the valve opening angle and transmits data back to the ECU. Full use has been made of CAE to create a throttle body that is both stronger and lighter. Optimum starter equipment can be selected for a variety of usage conditions, including local emissions regulations, temperature, and elevation.\n\nElectronic Control Unit\n\nThis ECU is used to control the engine. The ECU detects the throttle operation of the rider, the temperature, the air pressure, and other environmental conditions and then issues commands regarding airflow as well as fuel injection, spark timing, etc., to various devices, so that the engine operates in its optimum state. Our ECU for small motorcycles results in a more compact component configuration that makes it one of the smallest ECUs in the world.\n\nFuel Pump Module\n\nThe fuel in the tank is filtered, pressure is boosted by a pump, and fuel is supplied to the injectors by a pressure regulator built into the module. The pump uses a brushless motor to achieve higher life and smaller size. The size of the fuel pump module itself has been downsized so that it can be installed outside the fuel tank (in-line type), making it suitable for fuel tanks of various shapes and sizes.\n\nTransfer Mold ECU\n\nThis ECU is used to control the engine. The ECU detects the throttle operation of the rider, the temperature, the air pressure, and other environmental conditions and then issues commands regarding airflow as well as fuel injection, spark timing and others to various devices so that the engine operates at its optimum. A card-edge circuit board with connector-linking features, a transfer-molded case, and the new packaging technology eliminate potting resin results in an ECU that is 31% smaller and 46% lighter*. It is so small that it can fit in the palm of your hand.\n\nNote: In comparison with conventional Hitachi Astemo products.\n\nElectronic Control Unit with ACG Starter Control System\n\nThis ECU is compatible with idling shutoff features. The ECU detects the throttle operation of the rider, the temperature, the air pressure, and other environmental conditions and then issues commands regarding airflow as well as fuel injection, spark timing etc., to various devices, so that the engine operates at it’s optimum state. This ECU incorporates the AC generator (ACG) control with conventional ECU functions in a single unit to directly turn over the engine, resulting in a quiet startup and a smooth engine restart after idling shutoff. By conducting precise heat simulation testing to optimize component placement, we have developed this unit, resulting in a heat dissipation structure capable of withstanding a steady flow of ACG current.\n\nLarge Motorcycles\nElectronic Control Throttle Body\n\nThis component uses electronic control to adjust the amount of airflow to the engine.The ECU gathers information from various sensors in the vehicle to calculate optimum throttle opening based on the operating conditions. These instructions are then sent to the motor, which opens or closes the throttle valve in order to supply the right amount of air to the engine.At the same time, a throttle position sensor detects the opening angle of the throttle valve and sends that information back to the ECU.

We offer a broad lineup of products.\n\nElectric Power Steering System (Dual Pinion Assist Type)\n\nThe steering rack is equipped with two pinions, one of which connects the steering shaft in a conventional manner, and the other connects the power assist motor. Together they provide smooth initial turning or turning back of a steering wheel, giving the driver an excellent steering feel.\n\nManual Steering Gear for Column Assist EPS\n\nThis is a component of the column-assisted electric power steering system used in light, small, and medium-sized vehicles, and is characterized by its light weight and high rigidity. Since the steering gear ratio can be varied in relation to the steering angle of the wheel, it is possible to achieve a good balance between stability and maneuverability.\n\nMultiuse EPS\n\nBased on electric power steering technology for automobiles, the EPS has excellent durability and reliability and is widely used in ATVs (All-Terrain Vehicles) and MUVs (Multi Utility Vehicles).\n\nPower Steering Pump (Variable Displacement Type)\n\nSince the drive torque of variable displacement type pumps are lower than that of the fixed displacement types the pump can improve fuel economy. The pump also generates less heat, which suppresses a rise in oil temperature in the power steering system, making it possible to simplify or eliminate cooler piping. With a wide range of product variations, this product can be applied to everything from passenger cars to large trucks.\n\npage top\nDrivetrain Systems\n\nWe offer a wide range of products including compact, lightweight, and quiet differential gears, lightweight and high-rigidity CFRPs and aluminum propeller shafts, and propeller shafts with collision safety measures. Together these products contribute to improving the stability and driving performance.\n\nCFRP Tube Type (Propeller Shaft)\n\nThe CFPR Tube Type is lighter than steel tubes and contributes to improved fuel efficiency. In addition, while steel tubes are made in two pieces which increase the number of critical rotations, we have optimized the bending eigenvalue and torsional strength by adjusting the winding angle of the carbon fiber to make it possible to make it one piece. In the event of a vehicle collision, the structure is designed to crush easily in the axial direction under low load and mitigate risk to passengers.\n\nCFRP: Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics\n\nImpact Absorbable CVJ Type (Propeller Shaft)\n\nThe propeller shaft absorbs the impact of vehicle collision. The tube and constant-velocity joints contract for a sustained period of time under a low load to absorb impact and mitigate harm to passengers\n\nSingle-piece-type Propeller Shaft\n\nWhere the engine and axles are separated from each other, as on four-wheel-drive and rear-wheel-drive vehicles, the propeller shaft transmits the drive force generated by the engine to the axles. The friction welding adopted at the junction contributes to improved strength, quality, and durability of the junction. We have reduced both the number of components and weight.\n\n2-piece-type / 3-piece-type Propeller Shaft\n\nThe division of the propeller shaft into two- or three-parts enables a reduction in the critical number of revolutions preventing vibration issues from occurring when the length of the shaft is increased. A dynamic damper inserted into the pipe reduces vibration and noise.\n\nDifferential Carrier Assembly\n\nThe differential gear is a part of the power transmission device. The driving force generated by an engine is transmitted to the tires through various types of bevel gears. The differential gear assembly absorbs rotational differences due to the direction change of the rotational axis drive and/or the rotational differences between the right and left wheels that lead to smooth cornering.\n\nRubber Coupling Type (with Lobro Joint)\n\nRubber coupling is a joint composed of nylon cord and rubber that molds to the cord, and is effective in blocking engine vibrations by reducing the rigidity in bending, torsion and axial direction. In addition, the Lobro joint has zero internal gap, which reduces imbalance and suppresses muffled noise at high speeds. This combination makes it possible to improve the sound vibration and quietness of the vehicle.\n\nHypoid gear set\n\nThe hypoid gear in the final reduction gear unit changes the direction of drive. The gear converts rotation axis by 90°, and also offsets the torsion position relationship of the two gear axles. This gear set offers high strength and excellent quietness.\n\nDifferential Assembly\n\nSince a difference in rotational speed occurs between the left and right wheels when a car turns, a differential can be equipped to absorb the rotational difference. It can be installed in all vehicles—be it FF, FR, AWD, or BEV cars—and we deliver specifications according to the vehicle needs, such as adopting a TiN pinion shaft that excels in seizure resistance.\n\nTiN: Titanium Nitride Coating\n\nPinion Shaft\n\nThe pinion shaft used in the differential assembly is in a wear-prone environment because the gears placed onto the shaft rotate the surface. Nitriding and NiP are used for surface treatment to perform even in harsh environments, and TiN can be used in even tougher environments to significantly improve the anti-seizure properties.\n\nNiP: Electroless Nickel Plating\n\npage top\nBrake Systems\n\nWe develop innovative, reliable braking solutions that support electrification and weight reduction, contributing to greater safety and fuel efficiency.\n\nAutomated Parking Brake Disc Type\n\nAutomated Parking Brake Disc Type provides automakers with a variety of advantages such as improved safety, robustness and autonomous driving functions, including automated valet parking. They are also optimized for future e-mobility noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) requirements. The removal of lengthy cables and levers saves space, simplifies assembly processes and eliminates the need for parking-brake adjustments and pre-sets.\n\nAutomated Parking Brake Drum Type\n\nAutomated Parking Brake Drum Type is an innovative technology that allows automatic parking for a drum brake. The drum based electric parking brake allows for removal of lengthy cables and levers, saves space, simplifies assembly processes and eliminates the need for parking-brake adjustments and pre-sets. This system is also suitable for smaller cars.\n\nElectric Servo Brake\n\nElectric Servo Brake is an Hitachi Astemo eActuation solution. Combined with ESC, it provides all necessary functions to electric vehicles (e.g. regenerative braking with high level of recuperation). Electric Servo Brake also ensures redundant functionalities for autonomous vehicle Levels 3 and 4 thanks to the combination with ESC. One advantage of the system is that the pedal simulator is separated from the Power unit; this configuration is particularly suitable to vehicles with low pedal box packaging.\n\nESC: Electronic Stability Control\n\nFront Disc Brake\n\nOur front disc brake ZOHe AST™ family is a technology which combines outstanding quality and NVH performance with a high contribution to CO2 savings.\nOur innovative ZOHe AST™ even provides zero drag with unchanged pedal feel thanks to a unique combination of a specific material and a patented shape ensuring optimized distance between the pad and the disc during the life of the pad.\n\nZoHe:Zero Offset Harmonized evolution\n\nRear Disc Brake\n\nHitachi Astemo’s rear disc brake systems are well known for being the most compact mechanical parking brake solution. Rear disc brakes are adapted to all vehicle ranges.\n\nDrum Brake\n\nHitachi Astemo’s drum brakes provide high reliability and NVH robustness.\n\nNVH:Noise, Vibration and Harshness\n\nAluminum Knuckle\n\nAluminum knuckles are important platform parts which are connected to each arm of the suspension. They connect tires, discs and other parts to the car body. Reduce weight to improve fuel efficiency is one of our critical goals. By introducing high-strength aluminum materials, excellent elongation and high-quality casting technology, we have achieved a weight reduction of 30% to 40% compared to steel.\n\nRelated Contents\n\nCareers\n\nStories\n\nMotorsports\n\nHitachi Astemo, Ltd.\n\nNews Release\n\nCompany Information\n\nMessage from the President & CEO\nCompany Name & Brand\nCompany Overview\nFacilities\nHistory\nIR Materials\nHitachi Astemo in Numbers\nExhibition\nCompany Profile\n\nTechnologies\n\nResearch and Development\nMonozukuri\n\nSystems/Products\n\nAutonomous Driving / Advanced Driver Assistance Systems\nConnected\nSoftware\nPowertrain Systems\nChassis Systems\nMotorcycle Systems\nAftermarket Products\nPower Products & Industrial Equipment\n\nStories\n\nGroup Overview\n\nAmericas\nJapan\nEurope\nChina\nAsia\n\nSustainability\n\nEnvironmental Activities\nRelationship with Society\nPeople\nCorporate Governance\n\nCareers\n\nGermany/German\nMexico/Spanish\nFrance/French\nThailand/Thai\n\nMotorsports\n\nSitemap Contact Us\nSocial Media Accounts\nAccessibility Policy Terms of Use Privacy Policy Cookie Policy and Settings\n© Hitachi Astemo, Ltd. 2024.
